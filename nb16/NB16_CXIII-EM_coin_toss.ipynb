    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section XIV, we introduce Expectation-Maximization (EM) as a practical way to perform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) even when some of the data is hidden (i.e in the presence of latent or hidden variables). To better understand EM, in this short notebook we'll explore a very simple coin-tossing example adapted from [Do and Batzoglou, Nat. Biotechnol. (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1406). \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given two coins A and B with unkown bias $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, respectively. Our goal is to estimate the bias vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ from the outcomes of the following experiment: \n",

    "<blockquote> \n",
    "First choose one coin at random. Then toss the selected coin 10 times independently and record the number of heads observed. Repeat this procedure 5 times.\n",

    "Formally, let $z_i\\in\\{A,B\\}$ be the coin selected in experiment $i$ and $x_i\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots 10\\}$ be the number heads recorded by tossing $z_i$ 10 times. Since we conduct $n=5$ such experiments, we can summarize the outcomes of these 50 tosses by two vectors: $\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,x_2\\cdots, x_5)$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}=(z_1,z_2,\\cdots, z_5)$.\n",

The following code computes our best guess for the biases using MLE -- assuming we know the identity of the coin used -- and compares it estimates arrived at using an EM procedure where we have no knowledge about which coin was being tossed (though we know the same coin was tossed 10 times)."

Like with most optimization methods for nonconcave functions, E-M only guarantees convergence to a local maximum of the objective function. For this reason, its performance can be boosted by running the EM procedure starting with multiple initial parameters. "

    "Exercise 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. If we have complete knowledge of the experiment, then for each of the coins, we can try adding up all of the trials that got heads and divide by the total trials. The problem with this is that if the coin used in each trial is the same, you may end up with no data for one of the coins. It's unclear to be how to get around this. I guess this is an example of incomplete data, but having zero data for one of the coins seems like it's too incomplete. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. The likelihood of observing the complete outcome of the experiment is $P(x,z|n,\\theta)$. This is basically the product of all of the probabilities (probability of choosing coin A or B and probability of flipping heads or tails). \n",
    "\n",
    "c. The MLE is the choice for $\\theta$ that was given in part (a), which matches my intuition. This parameter $\\theta$ tries to maximise the log-likelihood or log($P(x,z|n,\\theta)$) \n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. I ran the code above 10 times and most of them had fewer than 10 iterations. The converged result is usually close to the MLE result. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. In the E-step we calculate the probability distribution. However, it can be seen as optimizing the variational free energy of the system. When we do this step, we only find the local maximum of log-likelihood. I'm not sure if it has to have a global max/min. \n",
    "\n",
    "c. The accuracy of MLE and EM largely depends on the specific experimental run. However, neither method seems to be consistently better than the other at being closer to the actual values of the coin biases. "
