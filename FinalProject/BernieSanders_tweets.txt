We have an opportunity to tell our grandkids that we took on one of the greatest challenges humanity has seen, defeated the wealth and power of the fossil fuel industry, and created 20 million jobs and a 100% renewable energy system.

Let's pass a Green New Deal.
We are not only going to legalize marijuana; we are going to expunge past convictions for marijuana possession. Thank you to @KimFoxxforSA for leading the way on this important issue. https://t.co/p3bWRSA8CV
Not every candidate is prepared to stand up to the outrageous greed of the drug companies and the insurance companies. I promise you that I am.
Before we create a Space Force we should make sure everyone has health care.
Are you ready for a really, really radical idea?

People in the richest country on Earth shouldn't have to take fish antibiotics to save money.

Medicare for All now. https://t.co/e6O2UKaXkp
I don't think Democrats should be using health insurance industry talking points to scare Americans about Medicare for All.

The bottom line: Medicare for All will save the average American thousands of dollars a year and guarantee comprehensive coverage to all.
I was so excited to speak to, and to draw, a brilliant young leader from the Sunrise Movement- and to talk about the Green New Deal and Bernie‚Äôs lifetime of standing up to power https://t.co/3uOFWJO1hY
When young people say they want to go to college without taking on mountains of debt, we must listen.

When young people say they want to end the criminalization of marijuana, we must listen.

When young people say they want a planet that is healthy and habitable, we must listen.
Incremental change is not enough. We are going to enact a Green New Deal because we have no other option if we want to save our planet. https://t.co/q3xg9QpeOF
Together, we will build a movement to reject divisiveness and all forms of racism and discrimination, including anti-Semitism.
In the United States and all over the world, we are witnessing a dangerous rise in anti-Semitic acts of violence.

I am deeply concerned about reports that the terrible shooting at a kosher supermarket in New Jersey was motivated by hatred of the Jewish people.

I don‚Äôt want us to just go back to where we were before Trump. I want us to ask some hard questions that we as a nation rarely do:

How is health care not a right in the richest country in the world?
Why do one in six of our children go hungry?
Why are 500,000+ people homeless?
Donald Trump thinks he can win re-election by dividing us up. He is dead wrong. We are the strongest campaign to beat Trump because we are bringing people together with a multiracial, working-class movement. https://t.co/AJ46OcqZB3

Every day, a new cruelty of the health care system makes itself clear. In this case, public scrutiny was thankfully enough to help this man, but countless others still struggle. That's what this whole thing is about. https://t.co/w0QcZbfrTu
At this moment in our history despair is not an option. I've got four kids and seven grandchildren. I can't give up. You can't give up.
This is America. You should not go bankrupt because you're diagnosed with a serious illness.
Deductibles are one of the most outrageous concepts in the history of the world. We're going to eliminate them under Medicare for All.
When I met John, a veteran, a few months ago, he had $139,000 in medical debt.

Thankfully today he is doing much better.

We must eliminate all medical debt‚Äîand when our veterans come home, they must receive the best quality health care this country can provide them. https://t.co/URQfPkBsnS

Medicare for All means freedom.

Right now, if you are poor, government turns its back on you, yet it welcomes the wealthy and their lobbyists. That is totally backwards.

If I told you someone was attacking the country, you would not hear politicians say, ‚ÄúWe have decades to deal with it.‚Äù

The major threat we are facing now is climate change.

We do not have decades to deal with it.

We need to pass a Green New Deal now.
We have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal by any candidate. Our Green New Deal will:

‚úÖCreate 20 million jobs
‚úÖTransition us to 100% renewable energy
‚úÖAvert climate catastrophe https://t.co/RkqHQdt5MK
Instead of taking from the poor and giving to the rich, we need to do the exact opposite. 

We need to end hunger in America and repeal the Trump tax breaks to the rich and the powerful.

As president, that's exactly what I intend to do.
Donald Trump‚Äôs food stamp rule is cruel, immoral and outrageous.

After giving over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations in America, no, Donald Trump, you do not take food out of the mouths of nearly 700,000 hungry Americans. https://t.co/HaAk3fB78y

-Health care
-Pension and early retirement support
-Priority placement in new good-paying union jobs https://t.co/ne5TdQQMNG
Have you ever postponed or skipped getting health care you needed due to the cost?
As you know, I don't spend my time traveling to ask big donors for money.

We won't have a super PAC.

And I'm not a self-funding billionaire ready to throw tens of millions of dollars into this race.

I just need small donors like you to chip in here. https://t.co/yf4tqTQvdR

Walmart‚Äôs CEO made 1,076 times more than the median Walmart worker last year.

Don't tell me Walmart cannot afford to pay a living wage to every worker.

They choose not to out of greed.
It's simple: we need a Green New Deal because our kids and grandkids deserve a habitable planet.
We can only transform this country by building a movement of workers, affected communities, and local leaders.

Huge corporations like Amazon and Walmart don't want unions because unionized workers have higher wages, better benefits and more control over their lives.

Unions are the last line of defense against corporate greed.

That's why we're going to double union membership nationwide.
I'm immensely proud of the work that young people are doing to lead the world in fighting the climate crisis.

When we are in the White House, young people will not be ignored.

They will be central to everything we accomplish.
I'm tired of a political and economic system that lets the billionaire class rig the system in favor of themselves and their friends. And so are the American people.
What the establishment used to say about our ideas:

Raising the minimum wage to a living wage‚Äîtoo radical.
Guaranteeing health care to all‚Äîtoo radical.
Aggressively combating climate change‚Äîtoo radical.
Not having a super PAC‚Äîtoo radical.

None of these are "radical" anymore.
I don't accept a system where billionaires get tax breaks while 1 in 6 teachers must work a second job.

Medicare for All means Medicare for ALL ‚Äî not some, or a few, or most.

Health care is a human right.

Every other major country recognizes that.

It's long past time the United States does as well.
We must set a national goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by the year 2025 so that HIV is no longer a public health threat to any community in the U.S. and that people with HIV are able to live long, healthy lives. https://t.co/mk37Xoo5Ql
Last week I met with students from @hgsuuaw, and this morning they began their strike. I stand with them in demanding Harvard's administration to guarantee student workers a living wage, access to adequate health care, and protection against harassment and discrimination. https://t.co/X2Om1lCHE4
I reject the idea that we can afford to pay for endless wars in the Middle East but not health care for all of our children.
.@RoKhanna knows from experience that the struggle for immigration justice is a civil rights struggle.

As president, I will use my executive authority to immediately reinstate and expand DACA and put a moratorium on deportations on day one of my presidency. https://t.co/Yw63GufO7e
This is what happened when people in the U.K. were asked how much health care costs in the U.S.

Remember that our outrageous for-profit system is not the norm in other countries.

We can and we must do better.

We need Medicare for All now.
https://t.co/AYGdRf8Lia
We‚Äôre thrilled to follow @CCIAction &amp; endorse @BernieSanders. We trust him to fight for students, #CollegeForAll (including undocumented &amp; formerly incarcerated students), &amp; a full cancellation of student debt. Anything less isn‚Äôt enough. #FC4A https://t.co/oXBV4KYcyp
Thank you @KamalaHarris for running a spirited and issue-oriented campaign. I look forward to working with you to defeat the most dangerous president in history and ending the hatred and divisiveness that he has created.
I very much hope that Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball can resolve their differences and maintain professional baseball in all the communities that currently have it‚Äîwhile addressing concerns about facilities, working conditions and wages for minor league players. https://t.co/5aGg67fe4x
20 million people are being displaced from their homes every year due to climate-fueled disasters.

20 million.

Half measures are not enough.

Our Green New Deal is the only sufficient response to the climate crisis put forward by any candidate.
The health insurance lobbyists who profit off of our broken health care system are scared because the American people are ready for Medicare for All.

We may not have their unlimited money, but we have the people, and we're going to win. https://t.co/9KtT12s9SQ
From standing with us on strike lines with fast food workers to touring rural Iowa plagued by factory farms, Bernie has helped build the political revolution we‚Äôve been building for decades. And we could not be more excited to have him build it with us in Iowa in 2020. https://t.co/aHpthLoqer
I stand in solidarity with the student workers at Harvard. All workers deserve respect, dignity, a living wage, access to adequate health care, and protection against harassment and discrimination. I urge the administration to bargain in good faith for a fair contract. https://t.co/8aNaRQMRpp
Greed and out-of-control consolidation in our corporate health care system means higher profits for executives and outrageous costs for patients.

We will take on this dysfunctional system and pass Medicare for All. https://t.co/1iFBTrHT6V
Prisons should not be for profit.

Health insurance should not be for profit.

We need to move in the direction of protecting human lives and dignity, not defending the limitless greed of massive corporations.

If you had a couple billion dollars, you could announce your candidacy for president and be taken seriously, even if you were the dumbest person on Earth.

Billionaires should not be able to buy our elections and we‚Äôre going to change that.
We have all the tools we need to end AIDS deaths and HIV transmissions. We just need the political will to do it. When we are in the White House, we will set a national goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by the year 2025. #WorldAIDSDay
Nurses are ready to fight for a movement builder like @BernieSanders ‚Äî someone who understands: it's not about "me," it's about "us."

#NursesForBernie #NotMeUs https://t.co/ZsdiboGVks
We have made great progress but too many people living with HIV and AIDS are suffering because they can‚Äôt afford the medicine they need.

With Medicare for All, we will cap out-of-pocket prescription costs at $200 a year and end price gouging on life-saving drugs. #WorldAIDSDay

Last year South Carolina spent:

$21,756 per prison inmate
$11,552 per student

It makes no rational sense to invest more in keeping people in prison than keeping them in school.

As president, I will do everything I can to reverse this absurdity.
No billionaires, super PACs or corporate lobbyists are supporting us, and we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. We are the strongest campaign to defeat Trump because we have millions of working people powering our campaign. https://t.co/gf2tTH4FJV
Running with the courage of your convictions is THE ONLY way to run‚Äîand win. 

@BernieSanders has been doing it since the beginning of his career in Burlington. And now he‚Äôs ready to take it to the White House.

Coal miners are not the enemy.

Oil rig workers are not the enemy.

Climate change is the enemy.

As we transition to 100% renewable energy, the Green New Deal will ensure a just transition for ALL fossil fuel workers.
Reminder: 136 days ago, the House voted to raise the minimum wage to $15.

That bill would‚Äôve increased pay for up to 27 million working people. The Senate GOP has yet to bring it to a vote. 

The Republican Party keeps going out of its way to keep Americans in poverty.
The top .0025% saw their wealth double in the last decade and their tax rate fall.

We have the money to provide basic necessities to our people.

What we need is the courage to take on the corporate elite.
64 years ago Sister Rosa Parks showed us there is no progress w/o struggle. We owe it to her legacy to never become cynical or complacent with the status quo.

@BernieSanders @ninaturner "When we read from the scriptures, the calling for the moment now is for nothing less than justice," @BernieSanders says, to applause from this Reid Chapel AME congregation.

Our Green New Deal is the most aggressive and comprehensive plan to deal with the climate crisis introduced by any candidate.

This is about the future of this planet and the lives of our kids and grandkids.

The American people will not accept a middle ground approach.
For too long, huge corporate monopolies have rigged our economy.

Their goal: maximize profits at the expense of small businesses and working Americans.

Under a Sanders administration, we'll take on their greed and allow small businesses to thrive. #SmallBusinessSaturday
Billionaires should not be able to buy elections.
It takes incredible courage to speak up against your employer, especially when they are the 2nd wealthiest man in the world.

Sahro, William and Tyler ‚Äì this movement stands with you.

When WE are in the White House we will restore power to the working class of this country. https://t.co/oO60gktwva
This holiday season take a moment to think of the postal workers who are working incredibly hard.

Trump wants to privatize the Postal Service and threaten 630,000+ jobs.

I believe we should strengthen USPS, protect jobs and allow post offices to provide basic banking services.
Amazon is one of the largest corporations in the world, but it paid $0 in federal income taxes.

It's owned by Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person on Earth.

It is not too much to demand it guarantees safe and decent working conditions for every worker.

#BlackFriday https://t.co/3iA5bFfpbt
The problems we face as a nation may seem insurmountable.

But if there ever was a time when despair was not an option, now is that time.

If we organize, if we stand together, if we refuse to let Trump divide us, we will win.
This endorsement is about more than just advancing one leader; it‚Äôs about advancing a grassroots movement for change.

It‚Äôs about ‚Äúus‚Äù ‚Äî the #nurses, the patients, the families, the communities that @BernieSanders is dedicated to uplifting. #NotMeUs https://t.co/4nulDWAFOh
My family lives on pensions and social security. Like Bernie, #IFightForThem to have their retirement with dignity. Protecting pensions and expanding Social Security is a key part of our movement.

I grew up in Brooklyn and went to public school my whole life. It was devastating for so many of my friends when it was time to apply for college &amp; they found out they were undocumented &amp; didn‚Äôt qualify for financial aid or scholarships. Till this day, #IFightForThem. #HereToStay
This Thanksgiving 500,000 Americans are homeless. I fight for them. 

45 million are dealing with student debt and hundreds of thousands will skip college due to cost. I fight for them.

87 million are underinsured or have no health insurance at all. #IFightForThem.
From being ‚Äòrandomly selected‚Äô at airports, to having our mosques vandalized &amp; our homes, cars, phones surveilled, my Muslim community has been criminalized by bigots &amp; those meant to protect us alike.

My mother did multiple jobs as I was growing up, in the kitchen of a restaurant and cleaning homes. Today domestic and agricultural (not to mention undocumented) workers still lack legal protections, a living wage, or a union, like Bernie, #IFightForThem.
I fight for the Americans who have never had a voice in the political process

The families struggling to put food on the table

The students shackled with debt

The seniors who cannot afford their prescriptions 

Millions of people are struggling, and like Bernie, #IFightForThem
My mom‚Äôs terminally ill &amp; shows the world that a disability shan‚Äôt stop anyone, my dad has student debt out his ears &amp; medical bills to boot.

#IFightForThem https://t.co/QVyGz6HQCo
My parents came to this country in search of a better life and sacrificed everything so my brother and I could follow our dreams. When my dad lost his job it became harder to pay for health insurance and it‚Äôll only get harder as they get older. Like Bernie, 
#IFightForThem #M4A https://t.co/RtGZu6z8nm
My parents are public school teachers who have 57 years of combined teaching experience. Though they love their jobs &amp; making a difference in students‚Äô lives, they don‚Äôt love paying $10k/year for employer provided heath insurance.

My mama has worked as a nurse for decades. Because of our expensive for-profit health care system, she‚Äôs had to delay retirement to be able to afford her medical bills as she's beaten cancer several times. Medical care should not be a luxury ‚Äî like Bernie, #IFightForThem. https://t.co/K91BJHkm7o
My parents didn't have easy lives. My father, a paint salesman, never made much money. My mother didn't live long enough to own a home as she dreamed.

But not one major Wall Street executive went to jail for destroying our economy in 2008 due to their greed and illegal behavior.

We're going to change that system.

No more cash bail.
No more death penalty.
No more "war on drugs."
No more mandatory minimums.
No more private prisons and detention centers.

We are going to fundamentally reform our broken and racist criminal justice system.
I don't think anyone in America should die because they can't afford to see a doctor.

Is that really so radical?

This is shameful. No student should be denied food PERIOD.

It‚Äôs why @TinaSmithMN and I have a bill to end school lunch shaming and @BernieSanders and I have a bill to make school meals universal. https://t.co/bwABeZX9LW
I stand with Byron Allen and @KillerMike. No company is above the law in our fight to end racial discrimination. https://t.co/FvnbTtZK8h
This is outrageous. When we're in the White House, we're going to make sure that no student goes hungry at a public school and we're going to eliminate the stigma surrounding children who get free or reduced lunch. https://t.co/NNow6ai5Ty
More than 100,000 Americans already die from air pollution each year, and Donald Trump is making it easier for his fossil fuel executive friends to poison your children.

We are going to end his outrageous corruption. https://t.co/vbLmEVNfjz
Some say that investing in a Green New Deal is not very practical. I think it is not very practical to allow millions of people to lose their homes, jobs and lives due to climate catastrophe.
For 40 years @BernieSanders has been fighting for us, it's time for us to fight for him. I proudly endorse Bernie Sanders! This is our time, let's go get this done! #NotMeUs

I am very concerned about what appears to be a coup in Bolivia, where the military, after weeks of political unrest, intervened to remove President Evo Morales. The U.S. must call for an end to violence and support Bolivia‚Äôs democratic institutions.
As president, I will end the ugly practice of deporting immigrant veterans who have put their lives on the line for this country, once and for all.

-fill the nearly 50,000 vacancies at the VA during his first year in office

-expand access to VA mental health and suicide prevention services.
I know very well where white supremacist politics leads, and what can happen when people do not speak up against it.

The political and media establishment want you to believe that poverty will always be with us.

They want you to believe that all you deserve as a worker is $10 or $12 an hour.

What this campaign is about is a new vision for what Americans are entitled to as human beings.
This @BernieSanders rally last night in Iowa with @AOC is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever heard in American politics.

Today, they have another event with @NaomiAKlein focused entirely on the climate emergency.

This is what it feels like to create change on the scale that‚Äôs necessary. https://t.co/lRuNWR0N5T

This is a climate crisis. A Green New Deal is the only sufficient response.
Hello Iowa! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëãüèΩ https://t.co/lSZcaPRO1k
Everyone alive today is living at a point that is literally unprecedented in all of human history.

Passing and enacting a Green New Deal must be a top priority. When I am president, it will be. https://t.co/lANfwu4F3O
I‚Äôve written about my preferences but I have never formally endorsed a candidate for President in my life - never mind spoken at a campaign rally.

That ends today in #Iowa. 

The world is on fire and our most credible hope of beating the arsonists is #Bernie2020 #NotMeUs
When you have 500,000 Americans sleeping on the street, 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, and millions struggling with student debt, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a radical idea to say: billionaires should not exist.
The 1% may have a whole lot of money and power.

But we have the 99% and we're going to win.

Our fight is not between workers who make $10 an hour and those who make $20 an hour.

Our fight is between the millions of Americans struggling just to get by and the handful of corporations and multibillionaires who hold obscene amounts of wealth and power.
We don't have a super PAC, we don't need a super PAC, and we don't want a super PAC.

We're going to win because of an unprecedented number of small donations from working people. Chip in here: https://t.co/dyMzTJaw3i https://t.co/TIsGp0yH4n

McDonald's claims it can't afford to pay a living wage to all workers.

Now it's giving its former CEO, who was fired, a $42 million exit package.

Corporate greed has no limit and we need a president who is prepared to take them on and end it.

That is exactly what I plan to do.
Greedy, corrupt fossil fuel corporations created the climate crisis. We will make them pay to stop it.
The Green New Deal is not just a climate plan. It is an economic plan. We will create 20 million jobs and invest $16.3 trillion in our economy.

Today @BernieSanders came out with an ambitious immigration plan that we think would go a long way towards fixing many of the problems with our broken immigration system. https://t.co/Y3DpraXRnS
No child should have to go to school not knowing if their parents will be there when they get home. We will keep families together and end the ICE raids terrorizing immigrant communities.
Say Bill Gates was actually taxed $100 billion. 

We could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country.

Bill would still be a multibillionaire.

Trump's treatment of immigration as a criminal and national security matter is inhumane, impractical, and must end.

It is outrageous that Republicans are threatening to effectively overturn the Kentucky election. In a democracy, we cannot allow politicians to just overrule election results. The will of voters must be respected. https://t.co/pAicPF6VFt
Congratulations to @TucsonRomero, the first Latina mayor of Tucson, on her historic win last night‚Äîand to @LUCHA_AZ and the other grassroots community activists that fought hard for this progressive victory. https://t.co/EiWuAlcup4
The hospital workers of @SEIUhciimk deserve a fair contract. No worker who provides vital health care services should be unable to afford their own health insurance. That's why we're fighting for Medicare for All and unions for all. https://t.co/vJIFDsfxNV
On the issue of climate change, we cannot be too aggressive. This is about the future of humanity. That is why we have put forth the Green New Deal‚Äîthe most comprehensive plan to address the climate crisis out of any campaign.
Thank you to Virginians for making history by standing up for health care, gun safety and voting rights, and for sending a clear message to Trump that we reject his hate and bigotry. https://t.co/E9cqlSbjLr
T-Mobile got this merger approved after spending nearly $200,000 at Trump's hotels.

This is a disastrous decision.

When we're in the White House we're going to end this corruption and break them up. https://t.co/4mkx55otkd
Last night voters across the country made clear: they're tired of a government that works for the 1% while working people suffer. They want real change.

Next year we'll finish the job by taking on Trump‚Äôs corruption. We'll sweep him and all he stands for out of the White House.
Some people say @IlhanMN and I make an odd political couple. In fact, there's nothing odd about it at all. Our story is the story of America. https://t.co/y62uSQmBJy
‚ÄúYou guys have won a victory that will not only be for Chicago but be for the whole country.‚Äù Thanks for the support, @BernieSanders! @CTULocal1 https://t.co/FiEK2pMzDg
Congratulations to the LA City Council for recognizing that we need Medicare for All and that the for-profit health insurance racket must end. No one should struggle to afford the care they need, and the American people are with us. https://t.co/vR4rmwWfUF

Homelessness isn‚Äôt a crime. It‚Äôs a symptom of the greed that is destroying housing in America.

When we are in the White House, we will stop the criminalization of homelessness and invest $32 billion over five years to end homelessness once and for all. https://t.co/eRvtxqMMmn
Thank you to all those in Manassas who came to help us get out the vote. We need everyone to turn out today in your state and local elections. Go to https://t.co/vMkvkrfLu1 to check your registration and find your polling place. https://t.co/uoQF7Wx6Xv
Jeff Bezos and Amazon think they can buy elections.

They spent $1 million to stop City Council candidates @d1forLisa, @TammyMoralesSEA, @VoteSawant and @ElectScott2019.

Show Amazon that they can't buy our democracy and that their corporate greed won't stand. Get out and vote!
Election Day should be a national holiday.
I encourage Albuquerque residents to vote yes on Proposition 2 today. We must move to publicly fund elections across the country in order to ensure a fair playing field free of the corrupting influence of large donors. https://t.co/mHh1D5O2SW

Corporations and the ultra-rich already had too much power in Washington. Trump made it even worse. We are going to reverse that and put power back in the hands of working people.

Donald Trump is an international embarrassment. https://t.co/djiVjPXDCM
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I don't believe democracy is about billionaires and corporations buying elections.
I know where I came from. My family fled war and displacement in Somalia. I sat for years in a refugee camp with no running water with the hope of a better life in America.

My destiny, your destiny, the destiny of workers around the world are linked together. #BerniesBackInMN https://t.co/8hfgfj8Gt7
We've never seen something like this in US history,

The climate crisis is an international challenge and we are ready to take it on with a Green New Deal.

I know where I came from. My father, whose family was wiped out by Nazism, came to the U.S. from Poland at 17 without a nickel in his pocket.

Like @IlhanMN, I believe that "my destiny, your destiny, the destiny of workers around the world are linked together." https://t.co/TY0jvHwet1
No matter how hard Trump tries, he will never succeed in dividing us. Thank you to @IlhanMN and the 10,000 people who came out to join our movement for justice in Minneapolis! https://t.co/mGuogs8kP1
How can you defend a system where 87 million are uninsured or underinsured?

Where we pay the highest prices in the world for prescriptions?

Where tens of thousands die yearly because they can't afford to see a doctor?

You can‚Äôt defend it. Medicare for All now.
This is a movement.

Together, we are going to create the America we deserve.

Don't let anyone tell you that we "can't afford" to make colleges tuition-free or cancel all student debt.

The billionaire class is stashing enormous amounts of wealth, and our tax code lets them.

We are going to make them pay their fair share.
Latest Polls:

New Hampshire (CNN): @BernieSanders in first place.

I appreciate Gov. Newsom taking this stand. Californians can't remain hostage to a profiteering corporation for a basic need. PG&amp;E's greed and corruption led to gross mismanagement of the state's electric system. Californians deserve a utility that's accountable to the people. https://t.co/b7GgR6rtnl

Thank you @BetoORourke for running a campaign to bring millions of people together, fight for justice for all and end gun violence in America. We are grateful for your leadership.
In 1965 the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 20:1.

Last year, it was 287:1.

Workers aren't struggling because they're not working hard enough.

They're struggling because more and more wealth is going to the people on top.

We're going to reverse that and give workers a raise.
Don't underestimate us. https://t.co/6jqoc5lG7z
Trump promised "insurance for everybody." Instead, nearly 500,000 children have lost health insurance since he took office. Enough is enough. We need Medicare for All now. https://t.co/LVwsHzNmVc

I stand with the former @Deadspin workers who decided not to bow to the greed of private equity vultures like @JimSpanfeller. This is the kind of greed that is destroying journalism across the country, and together we are going to take them on.
Our path to victory is not through big money. It‚Äôs through millions of people chipping in what they can before tonight's monthly deadline. Will you chip in to stand with Bernie? https://t.co/oHM2jWkAsF
"You shouldn‚Äôt accept any money from a super PAC, because people can‚Äôt possibly trust you." ‚ÄìJoe Biden, 2018

What we are saying is not radical. 

What we are saying is that if you can't afford thousands of dollars for health insurance premiums, you should not have to suffer and potentially die.

Democracy means more than the right to vote. It means control over your life and the work you do. We are fighting for workers to be treated as more than cogs in a machine. https://t.co/d5AZVpMIns
People tell us, "Oh my God, it can't be done. Can you imagine everyone in America having health care?"

Duh.

That's how it is in every other major country except the United States.
Our campaign is not only about changing the system politically and economically. We will change the value system of this country.

We‚Äôre not going to worship corrupt billionaires anymore.

We‚Äôre going to respect teachers and childcare workers and the working people of America.
No one was supposed to find out about this. https://t.co/cx4vQtFC28

U.S. schools are resorting to shameful tactics like threatening to ban students who can't afford meals from prom and graduation.

This is a campaign for the working class‚Äînot billionaires who want to buy elections. Our fight is a fight to stop corruption, end corporate greed and give working families the security they deserve.
https://t.co/XE6tEHXM4U
Powerful people who say that Medicare for All is an "impossible" idea usually stand to profit from defending our corrupt, corporate-run health care system.
Political and media elites might write off our campaign. That's fine. We have more individual contributions than any campaign at this point in history, from working people everywhere. And we're going to win.
If you think the future only belongs to the rich and the powerful, then that‚Äôs the future you will have. But if you believe that when we stand together we can take them on, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.
.@chesaboudin knows that under our constitution, everyone is guaranteed equal justice under the law, not just the very rich and powerful.
I‚Äôm proud to endorse @chesaboudin to be San Francisco's next District Attorney. In America today we have a broken criminal justice system that criminalizes poverty, perpetuates institutionalized racism, and continues a failed war on drugs that has devastated communities of color.
We are immensely proud to receive the endorsement of Senator @BernieSanders.
  
Bernie has devoted his life to standing up for overlooked &amp; underserved ppl in America, &amp; understands the dysfunction of our current criminal justice system. 

Thank you for your support Bernie! ‚úä https://t.co/URVyCXnA3s

I've said it before and I'll say it again: you can't fix a corrupt system if you're taking its money.
"What can I do to uplift you all? What can I do to support you all?"

Thank you Detroit and Rep. @RashidaTlaib! Our message to the top 1% and powerful corporations: this nation belongs to all of us, not just the few. Can you hear us now? https://t.co/TvvHizsJGU
‚ÄúWe deserve someone who writes the damn bill. We deserve Bernie Sanders,‚Äù U.S. Rep. @RashidaTlaib said while giving her endorsement to @BernieSanders at a rally Sunday in Detroit. https://t.co/zTODHOiwI7
Don't let anyone tell you that our vision is radical or extreme. Radical and extreme is giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% when half a million Americans will be homeless tonight. That's radical.
Don't believe anyone who tells you that moving toward a society of justice is impossible.
Tonight, we celebrate John Conyers. He was a champion for civil rights and understood long before it was popular that health care is a human right.

Thank you, John, for a life of extraordinary service. https://t.co/w0fjwkIRpe
"I am endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he's not gonna sell us out. He understands that it's not just about policies and about words, but it's going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place." -@RashidaTlaib https://t.co/3SaGZeOUT7
If there ever was a time for millions of people to come together and build a mass movement for justice, now is that time. Join us live from Detroit at our rally with @RashidaTlaib, Jack White, and more: https://t.co/WhhoZXAbup
Our Congressman forever, John Conyers, Jr. He never once wavered in fighting for jobs, justice and peace. We always knew where he stood on issues of equality and civil rights in the fight for the people. Thank you Congressman Conyers for fighting for us for over 50 years.
Today marks one year since the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. We mourn for the eleven victims, and we remain committed to fighting white supremacist violence as the national security threat that it is.
It is time to begin thinking about public ownership of major utilities.
Our hearts go out to Californians affected by the devastating wildfires. Climate change is real, and when I am president, we are going to treat this like the existential crisis it is.
Tonight: join me and @RashidaTlaib for a rally featuring live performances by Jack White and the Cass Tech Madrigals! Watch live at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS.

If you are wealthy and powerful, or maybe the president, you are above the law. But if you are poor, if you're Black, if you're Hispanic, it's a different story. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I happen to believe in equal justice for all people. https://t.co/GLLgI3KBVc

Welcome to #13thDistrictStrong @BernieSanders! https://t.co/D6zs83vpwm
The primary goal of a criminal justice system should not be punishment, but whenever possible, rehabilitation.
With only 100 days left until the Iowa caucuses, one of the most important things you can do is make calls to voters. Help us reach our goal of 2,000,000 before the end of October: 
https://t.co/YcvS3rWIe9
We are the only campaign with more donations than Trump and that is exactly why we are going to defeat him and transform this country. Thank you, T.I. https://t.co/n2cvZNyMJg
Trump and his billionaire friends are using corrupt schemes to profit off low-income communities. When we defeat Trump, we‚Äôre going to end this tax scam an invest in working-class communities that have been fleeced. https://t.co/s7JWfIOS3q

We are coming to Detroit on Sunday to challenge this kind of corruption and corporate greed. When we defeat Trump, billionaires are going to stop ripping off communities and start paying their fair share ‚Äî whether they like it or not https://t.co/JeZk7YnOJg
Trump lied when he said he‚Äôd stand up to corporate greed and help working people. We‚Äôre going to do what he failed to do: end corporate greed, stop corruption and raise wages for workers. Join our rally in Iowa City: https://t.co/DtQQuGkBgX
Every day, it becomes more obvious that having 45 million people drowning in $1.6 trillion of student debt is not sustainable.
We are going to cancel ALL student debt. https://t.co/CaB9HhI2pq
A Wall Street executive commits fraud, he gets bailed out by the American people and handed enormous tax breaks.

A young kid gets arrested for smoking marijuana, he ends up with a criminal record.

We're going to end that absurdity.
Congratulations to the @UAW members who fought to secure a better contract at GM. Unions like UAW give workers the ability to organize and collectively bargain for justice on the job. We're going to rebuild the trade union movement across the country. https://t.co/oLENwNpiok
Today is Larry Itliong Day in California, honoring the courageous Filipino American labor leader whose union members began the historic and groundbreaking Delano Grape Strike. @UFWupdates #LarryItliongDay #LaborHistory #1u https://t.co/JMAcuEyLuM

We are more than halfway to our goal of 2 million calls to voters before the end of the month. That is incredible. Help us across the finish line: https://t.co/YcvS3sejCJ
Why @BernieSanders?

He‚Äôs building more than a campaign. He‚Äôs leading the movement to build a future we can all be proud of. One where healthcare is guaranteed, student debt is cancelled, and our planet is thriving. https://t.co/FpwspMBK83
If all of you stand up and fight back against corporate greed, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. Join us live in Toledo, Iowa: https://t.co/9GwNvhj8Ku
We must legalize marijuana, but that is not all. We will also ensure that revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in communities hit hardest by the War on Drugs, especially African-American and other communities of color.

When workers stand together, fight back, and demand an end to corporate greed‚Äîthey win. Congratulations to the Blackjewel miners on this victory! We are going to ensure all fossil fuel workers have the just transition they deserve. https://t.co/FTTf9i7UvT
The ideas that I am talking to you about didn't come to me yesterday.

They didn't come because I have pollsters saying, "Hey Bernie, this is polling pretty well, you might want to pick that one up."

These are ideas that I have fought for my entire life.
Thank you @SenSanders for supporting striking  @ATULocal689 Transdev workers, @ATUComm and working people across the United States. #TogetherWeFightTogetherWeWin! https://t.co/Ke0fgghOza
A Green New Deal is not a pipe dream. It is absolutely necessary. I refuse to stand by and watch this crisis get worse. https://t.co/NnNaMRFZiq
This is *huge.*

A top Trump official admitted the student debt crisis is ‚Äúinsanity‚Äù and called for partial cancellation.

@BernieSanders and I want to cancel it all. https://t.co/Vqh8XxgJPz
Marijuana should be legal.
"Supporters of #MedicareForAll are right. Funding it through taxes would lead to a large tax cut for the vast majority of workers ... &amp; the data show that for most workers, it would lead to the biggest take-home pay raise in a generation," @gabriel_zucman

Right now there is a movement of workers across the country who are taking back their power at a scale we have not seen in recent memory. I stand with educators in Dedham, Massachusetts. This takes courage. https://t.co/KE1APXyI04
With a strong union, workers get the basic protections they deserve. Unions like ATU are defending workers every day against the expansion of corporate greed within our transit systems. I support @ATULocal689 in its fight for justice. https://t.co/KQgm5ih506

When we said four years ago that we needed to legalize marijuana, it was considered a "radical" idea.

Today, 11 states plus DC have legalized it. Not so radical anymore.

When we're in the White House we will do so nationwide.
The only way we‚Äôll be able to end corporate greed and defeat powerful special interests is if we give workers the power and resources they need to organize and fight back. I have a plan to do that. Join me live in Iowa: https://t.co/9Ozwaf8kz0
Legalize marijuana. Expunge past convictions. End the War on Drugs.
Today, the government considers marijuana as dangerous as heroin.

That‚Äôs idiotic.

As president I will immediately issue an executive order to declassify marijuana as a controlled substance.
Breaking: @BernieSanders new marijuana legalization plan includes several measures to prevent industry consolidation and ensure communities most harmed by the War on Drugs benefit from legalization https://t.co/fdd9KZZmJt https://t.co/CbNSZBv3w5
NEW: ‚Å¶@BernieSanders‚Å© released a plan to legalize marijuana, expunge pot related convictions, and take steps to shape the legal sales industry. Story from ‚Å¶@GregJKrieg‚Å©, ‚Å¶@ryanobles‚Å© and me. https://t.co/AebsnokuR2
It's 4:20 and @BernieSanders has rolled out a pot legalization plan:
 
-Legalize in first 100 days by EO 
-Expunge records &amp; implement clemency reform
-$50b in grant programs
-Eliminate barriers to benefits; no drug testing requirements
-Keep industry from becoming Big Tobacco https://t.co/dQpF0Wmq8I
Too many lives were ruined due to the disastrous criminalization of marijuana. Today I am releasing my plan to:

‚úÖ Legalize marijuana with executive action
‚úÖ Expunge past marijuana convictions
‚úÖ Invest in communities most affected by the War on Drugs

Interesting, I‚Äôd like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. https://t.co/zfv9U0Liut
On Nov. 6, Uber investors will walk away with billions while drivers sleep in their cars. I stand with workers in the gig economy as they organize and fight for a more equal society. When we're in the White House, we will stop this exploitation of workers.

Sen. @BernieSanders was the first presidential candidate to stand with our teachers and school staff as they prepared to go on strike in Chicago. 

For this and many other reasons, I'm proud to stand with him. #NotMeUs #Bernie2020 https://t.co/IcFbHtcc6H
I support @BernieSanders because we can trust him to take on the corporate elite &amp; win transformational change for us. Bernie has the most consistent &amp; progressive track record of any candidate, and he's the only one building a multiracial working class movement to defeat Trump. https://t.co/Z8mRoz151Q

Millions of people in this country are disenfranchised and their voices left out of our political process. If you have the ability to get involved, I am asking you to fight for those who do not.

#ExxonKnew the science that showed its products were creating a climate disaster, and the company suppressed that science. When I am president, we will launch a criminal investigation of the fossil fuel corporations and their executives who knowingly created the climate crisis.
Zuckerberg and billionaires have used their power to control too much of the political and economic life of America. Their greed knows no boundaries. The only thing that will stop it is a movement to say enough is enough. We will reduce the power of Facebook and other monopolies.

You just imagined every major country except the United States.

Make sure kids aren't hungry at school.
Pay all teachers at least $60,000 a year.
Allow everyone to go to college if they wish.

That's our "radical" education agenda. This is the richest country on Earth. We can ensure our people can learn and live with dignity.
The people want the right to a green, affordable home. And together, that is exactly what we are going to guarantee to every American. https://t.co/1ocMzeLLMR
The way you win an election at this time in history is not the same old, same old.

You have to inspire people.

You have to bring working people, young people and poor people into the political process.

When we do that, we will not only defeat Trump. We will win in a landslide.

Trump is a racist, a sexist and a xenophobe. Despite all of that, he will be a very formidable opponent.

We can beat him and we will beat him. But we cannot take anything for granted.

To win, we have got to create the largest voter turnout in the history of the country.

I know where I stand.
I stand with the @steelworkers and @Teamsters who are out on strike against ASARCO's unfair labor practices. Many of these workers have not received a raise in nearly 10 years and they deserve justice. https://t.co/QLOIy8CICO

Jailing people for the ‚Äúcrime‚Äù of getting sick is immoral, unconscionable, and un-American. Together, we will eliminate past-due medical debt, stop the predatory tactics of debt collectors, and end this barbaric practice once and for all. https://t.co/ywrG8cE42I
As president, I will guarantee this: when 50% of workers in a unit sign an authorization card, plus one, they will have a union. End of discussion.

If employers refuse to negotiate in good faith, we will impose strong penalties on those companies.
It is really sad that Joe Biden is using the talking points of the insurance industry to attack Medicare for All.

Under our plan, funded in a progressive manner, all Americans will have comprehensive health coverage as a guaranteed human right with no out-of-pocket expenses. https://t.co/m52Vtid3Dw
Not only is Trump using the powers of the presidency to enrich himself, which is blatantly unconstitutional.

He is ignoring a massive international crisis that threatens humanity.

It was my honor to work closely with Rep. Elijah Cummings over the years. His integrity and moral vision for his community and the country were extraordinary. He will be sorely missed. Jane and I are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend. Our thoughts are with his family.
I have a message for Donald Trump: no, we‚Äôre not going to hate Latinos, we‚Äôre not going to hate Muslims, we're not going to hate immigrants. We are going to stand together and refuse to let you divide us up.
Congratulations to the members of @SEIU73 at the Chicago Park District on winning a tentative agreement that values their important work.

Happy #NationalBossDay to the 10 million workers in nearly 7,000 employee-owned businesses. When we are in the White House, we are going to dramatically expand employee ownership and workplace democracy.
Pharma executives knew opioids were addicting and killing people. They sold them anyway.

Fossil fuel executives knew their emissions were threatening the planet. They continued anyway.

This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to our world.

We are going to end this greed.
This is a positive step forward in these negotiations. Our movement continues to stand with the thousands of @UAW members who are still walking picket lines across the country. https://t.co/8cJKG7aYA4
This is the difference between myself and Joe Biden. https://t.co/DVajgDHdCZ
When we win, we are going to fundamentally change the nature of the presidency. I will not only be commander-in-chief, but organizer-in-chief. And we will take on the most powerful corporations and special interests.
I'm so excited to have @AOC join us at our rally in New York this weekend. Help us show the powerful special interests that we're not backing down and join us on Saturday in Queens: https://t.co/nyqtMVEcXQ

Unfettered capitalism created the opioid epidemic. That is why we need a political revolution to say enough is enough. #DemDebate
Sanders: "What country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States" after he has betrayed the Kurds? Exactly.
.@BernieSanders is right. With millions of Americans at risk of losing their jobs to #automation, we need to make strong investments in our economy to protect good jobs. #1u

That starts with supporting #unions that strengthen the voices of hardworking families. #DemDebate https://t.co/aygiIHWhGj
If you are asking me, do I think we should demand the wealthiest start paying their fair share of taxes, so we can have a government and a nation that work for all of us? Then yes. That is exactly what I believe. #DemDebate
We need a Green New Deal to save this planet. https://t.co/mGDuwtTfLw
When we are in the White House, that is exactly what we will do. https://t.co/lWLXzl8Lh3
We will guarantee every American a job through a #GreenNewDeal.

500,000 Americans are homeless.

87 million are uninsured or underinsured.

45 million have student debt.

All while 3 people own more wealth than the bottom half.

We cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption is at war with the working class of this country.
This is the issue: Does the Democratic Party have the guts to stand up to corrupt and greedy insurance companies that bankrupt 500,000 people every year?

If we don‚Äôt have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves. #DemDebate https://t.co/WFOsT7GJUT
Yes, @BernieSanders: totally right. We have to have the guts to take on the totally dysfunctional healthcare system we have right now ‚Äî and that means taking on the private for-profit companies that are the only ones benefiting from our current system.
Damn right we will guarantee a job for every American. #DemDebate
Let's be clear. Under Medicare for All:

‚úÖ Premiums are gone
‚úÖ Deductibles are gone
‚úÖ Copayments are gone

Some call me "radical" for suggesting that corporations should pay their fair share in taxes.

Here is what is radical:

Amazon, one of the richest and most powerful companies in the world, owned by the richest man on Earth, pays $0 in federal income taxes.
Donald Trump didn't drain the swamp. He is the swamp. https://t.co/XjyATiBdAj

Private media outlets charge outrageous sums to run ads during presidential primary debates like tonight's‚Äîand many of their advertisers have vested interest in who is elected.

This type of influence must end.

We're going to ban advertising during presidential primary debates.

Democracy doesn‚Äôt just mean the chance to vote. It means control over your life.

To be a truly democratic society, we must create an economy where workers feel that they‚Äôre not just a cog in the machine, but that they have power over their jobs and workplaces. https://t.co/8RMESY13k2

What they would have paid under our plan:

Amazon: $3.8 billion
Delta: $1.8 billion
Chevron: $1.6 billion
GM: $1.5 billion
Tax the billionaires.
We need a Green New Deal now because Americans are already suffering from the climate crisis. I refuse to stand by and watch this crisis get even worse. https://t.co/61UjVQQfif
A great nation is not judged by the size of its corporate tax breaks.

It's judged by how it treats its most vulnerable people.

That is why we are going to end virtually all corporate tax breaks and loopholes and invest in working Americans.
The time is long overdue for the Native American people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. #IndigenousPeoplesDay https://t.co/Sd697H7Ip2
NEWS: @BernieSanders comes out against the U.S. Air Force's expansion into the Desert National Wildlife Refuge, citing tribal opposition and the federal government's failure to protect tribal treaty. #IndigenousPeoplesDay https://t.co/UZ96PGHzc3
Medicare for All expands coverage to include dental care, vision care and hearing aids‚Äîbecause having teeth, the ability to see and the ability to hear shouldn't be luxuries.
You can't be an American company and not pay American taxes. We're going to repeal ALL of Trump's outrageous corporate tax breaks and close all corporate tax loopholes, including the use of offshore tax havens.
Today on #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we celebrate Native communities and remember that this country owes them so much. I stand with them in the fight improve their quality of life and to protect their treaties and tribal rights.
Absolute majorities of Americans support key planks of Bernie Sanders' worker ownership plan (announced today). The people want a democratic economy + to transfer wealth and power to workers. @BernieSanders has stepped up, other politicians must follow. (@DemocracyCollab data) https://t.co/YGM055Ak7E

‚Äì giving workers ownership stakes in their companies
‚Äì reversing major corporate mergers
‚Äì undoing the Trump administration‚Äôs corporate tax cuts

‚úîÔ∏èOverturn Citizens United
‚úîÔ∏èBan advertising during presidential primary debates
If you can spend billions of dollars on stock buybacks to enrich shareholders and can pay your CEO millions of dollars a year, you can damn well afford to pay your workers a living wage.

The median household income in the U.S. last year was about $62,000.

Someone making that much could work for 1.5 million years‚Äînot spend any of it‚Äîand still not be worth as much as Jeff Bezos.

Billionaires should not exist.
In the last few years, PG&amp;E has:

Californians are suffering because of this greed and corruption. We need a Green New Deal to end this now. https://t.co/gSbvZyg10Y
Thank you @berniesanders for joining me in addressing the need to restore voting rights to incarcerated Americans.During Jim Crow, states used incarceration &amp; poll taxes to keep ppl of color out of the voting booth. It‚Äôs past time to make our democracy more real #restorethevotedc https://t.co/u4UQpgP3UF
No one should live in fear because of who they are or whom they love. Today and every day we stand with our LGBTQ+ family. Together, we are going to build the nation based on love and justice we know we can become. #ComingOutDay
We cannot allow corporate America to continue to destroy journalism. When I am president we will tell the owners of @splinter_news, @SInow, @mcclatchy, @Gannett, and others that they must end their greed and respect their workers or face consequences. https://t.co/xO7Kd9Kkw9
This is not a radical idea. If we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy, we must firmly establish that the right to vote is an inalienable and universal principle. Period. https://t.co/KCzUMAwOQ3
Thanks to the work of community organizers including @CIYJA and @CA4ImmiJustice, California has the opportunity to have the strongest private prison ban in the country. I urge Gov. Newsom to sign #ab32 and ban all private prisons, including private immigration detention. https://t.co/Z1RqraYHC8
This year alone, 19 transgender people in the U.S. have been violently killed. That is a tragedy and an outrage.

When we are in the White House will make it clear that every murder of a transgender person will be investigated by the Department of Justice as a severe hate crime.
When politicians like Trump say we must cut food stamps, Medicaid and public housing, it's not because we don't have the money.

We're the richest country on Earth!

It's because they refuse to stand up to their billionaire donors, who hoard wealth and stash it in tax havens.
No person needs to have tens of billions of dollars while others sleep out on the streets. We're going to tax the ultra rich and use the revenue to guarantee decent housing for all.
Mental health care shouldn't be a privilege for the wealthy. It should be accessible to all. Medicare for All will guarantee mental health coverage to every person in this country, free at the point of service. #WorldMentalHealthDay
It's not coincidental that the top health care CEOs made $1.1 billion last year while 4 in 10 cancer patients lose their life savings due to treatment.

Our system is designed to take money from sick people and put it in the pockets of rich executives.

We need Medicare for All.
Let me congratulate the @massaflcio on their support for Medicare for All. When every American has comprehensive health care as a right, unions will no longer have to spend enormous amounts of time and energy fighting to maintain their employer-based health insurance benefits. https://t.co/6rrLgiqnEW
Playoff baseball comes to our backyard. https://t.co/mKVxw7FPbI
At the end of the day, we have one life to live, and you ask yourself, what role do I want to play?

That role must go deeper than defeating Trump.

We must create a country where people are working to take care of each other. https://t.co/g327uGrRow
Irresponsible corporate greed threatened the health and safety of 800,000 Californians. Meanwhile, PG&amp;E has paid out billions to its shareholders. My Green New Deal will build a 21st century energy grid that will deliver clean, reliable power to all. https://t.co/nxgE58Xiu9
Trump thinks human life is about cheating and stepping on people to get rich. My view is that we are all richer emotionally when we care about each other. https://t.co/dnNYpE67Rs
The insurance and pharmaceutical companies are going to spend millions and millions of dollars attempting to defeat us and stop Medicare for All. That is how you can tell we are on the side of working people. https://t.co/RsClWuZsh2
If you don't think our tax system is rigged in favor of the wealthy, remember that the Waltons (worth over $200 billion) pay a lower tax rate than entry-level workers at Walmart.
Our health care system today exists to make as much profit as possible for a handful of rich executives.

Maybe I'm "radical," but I believe our health care system should exist to keep people healthy. https://t.co/yhIcNysujg
Ken Langone, the billionaire founder of the Home Depot, wants to know what we'll do for working people.

Donald Trump, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett pay a lower tax rate than someone making $7.25 an hour.

Let that sink in.

In a Sanders administration that ends. We will tax extreme wealth and make the rich pay their fair share. https://t.co/mqVoYTR8Uc
Let's remember that Sondland is a million-dollar Trump donor. That's how Trump's swamp works. https://t.co/JCKY2D5HeZ

One million donors. 

That‚Äôs how many people are funding this campaign ‚Äî and all of their names are now on the wall at our campaign headquarters. Because this campaign is not just about me. It‚Äôs about all of us fighting for justice, together. https://t.co/bq6TjDm9A0
Good! https://t.co/LP3PuEZDzB
Our grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don't need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president.
Not only are we going to defeat Trump, we're going to make him pay an additional $142 million with our tax on extreme wealth.
When we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.
Money is not speech.

Corporations are not people. 

And you shouldn't have to beg the rich and powerful for money to run for office. 

Today we are releasing our plan to get corporate money out of politics. https://t.co/kMGmyf4DMZ
Passing Medicare for All and eliminating all past-due medical debt is not only our moral obligation. It is economically necessary. https://t.co/TdvIUxeQ2f
Trump's vision of government is one that serves the rich and attacks the poor. We have a different idea. We are going to protect the programs that are life-and-death for millions of working people and make the wealthy pay their fair share. https://t.co/kNO6mdXaBt
Maybe I'm old fashioned. But I believe we should have a president who believes in the United States Constitution.

We set an ambitious goal: 1,000,000 calls to early states in 10 days. It took our volunteers just nine.

This is the unprecedented grassroots power that we need to not only defeat Donald Trump, but to take back our democracy from the corporate elite. https://t.co/rpC4AhrRUm
Wow. Just wow.

This is the single best, most insightful, most inspirational campaign ad of the 2020 presidential election.

Thank you to @0rf for not only showing the world how kind and compassionate @BernieSanders is, but showing just how far off base coverage about him can be. https://t.co/ygUiE7Vf98
At this point in the campaign, we've received contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of American presidential politics‚Äîand the overwhelming majority of those donations comes from the working class.

This is what the political revolution looks like. https://t.co/P4usjUyBo2
When we say the system is rigged in favor of the rich this is what we mean. We need a government that works for working people, not just the rich and powerful.

It's going to be a real pleasure defeating you. https://t.co/L8TGcUYy4G
Here's Trump's brilliant idea: tell Americans that we cannot guarantee health care for all to distract from the fact that he's the most corrupt president in our modern history. Another great idea from our "stable genius" president. https://t.co/dCf3gBrLWy
I'm looking forward to sharing our vision for transforming this country at the next debate.

I am lucky to have great health care, but millions of Americans are not. Some 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.

That is unacceptable to me. We need Medicare for All.
I intend to make sure Bernie takes a few days off to rest, but he's ready to get back out there and we‚Äôre looking forward to the October debate. Again, thank you all for your wonderful support. It really does mean a lot to us. 3/3

‚ÄúYou have CEOs making 500 or 1000 times more than the median income worker ‚Äì that‚Äôs a signal of a lot of what is wrong in this country. We want to make clear that‚Äôs bad policy and we will impose taxes on the most egregious examples.‚Äù -‚Å¶@BernieSanders‚Å© https://t.co/N5Q4kShN24

Taxing the extreme wealth of the top 0.1% is not radical.

Trump wants to divide us up, because that's the only way he can win. We reject that. We are about bringing people together and sharing in a common humanity.
https://t.co/MInQPgcyAq
Here's a pretty reasonable idea: getting an education shouldn't mean that you're in debt for the rest of your life.
Anyone attacking Medicare for All needs to explain why we should maintain a system in which the average premium workers pay for family coverage has increased 71% in 10 years.

Donald Trump is a spoiled brat. 

He grew up as a very rich kid. And now he thinks he can do anything he wants. 

Most people work hard, they tell the truth, they pay their taxes. Trump does the opposite.
When we stand together, when we organize, when we do not back down, we win. I'm proud to support @CTULocal1 teachers in their fight for the schools our kids deserve. https://t.co/tI3asZJ2xG

Getting an education isn't a crime. We need to cancel every penny of student debt.
GM showed why we need Medicare for All. Your health care should never be in the hands of greedy corporations who can take it away to punish workers. We will guarantee health care for all with no co-pays, premiums, or deductibles. https://t.co/4Xjo00naOJ
Union workers earn 22% more, on average, than non-union workers. I think that explains a lot about why greedy corporations try to bust unions.

This is only the tip of an iceberg of corrupt, illegal and immoral behavior by Trump. The House must thoroughly investigate Trump's cover-up of this call and his other attempts to use government resources to help his re-election. The public deserves full transparency. https://t.co/ckKLUsiAGb

Trump‚Äôs corruption and self-dealing is limitless. The House is right to begin impeachment proceedings.
Make the wealthy pay their fair share.
If American Airlines can spend $15 billion on stock buybacks, it damn well has enough money to pay its union workers a decent wage with good benefits. And under no circumstances should it ever outsource jobs to low-wage countries with a track record of safety violations. https://t.co/MDWXGxheiO
We will no longer tolerate teachers all over America having to work two or three jobs to get by. I was proud to stand last night with @CTULocal1 and @SEIU73. We're going to win and give teachers the life they deserve. https://t.co/xZokYTJQMg
We are going to end homelessness and build millions of new affordable housing units ‚Äî paid for with a tax on the billionaire class. https://t.co/e489hW8kIi
How to not get a federal contract in a Sanders administration:

-Pay workers poverty wages
-Outsource jobs
-Engage in union busting
-Deny good benefits
-Pay CEOs outrageous compensation
Remember when Trump shut down the government?

800,000 federal workers do, because they missed their paychecks or worked without pay for over a month.

Federal workers must be guaranteed the same labor rights as private sector workers, including the right to strike.
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in the modern history of this country.

Enough is enough.

I hope the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House will begin the impeachment process. https://t.co/WHth62v5br
We appear to have a president who may have used funds designed to protect the security of the United States as a means to gain political dirt on an opponent.

We need to begin the impeachment process immediately.
Clear your mind for a moment and count to 10.

In those 10 seconds, Jeff Bezos made more money than the median employee of Amazon makes in an entire year.

We have a crisis of inequality. We're going to address it with a wealth tax on the top 0.1%.
A small handful of billionaires should not be able to accumulate more money than they could spend in 10 lifetimes while millions of Americans are living in poverty and dying because they can't afford health care.
While working Americans ration insulin and work 2 or 3 jobs, the 1% saw its wealth increase by $21 trillion in the last 30 years.

The problem is not that Americans aren't working hard enough or saving enough money.

The problem is that the whole system is rigged against them.
If we make the top 0.1% pay their fair share in taxes, their quality of life would not change at all. But we would be able to invest in housing, child care and health care and improve the lives of millions of working people.
There is no justice when three billionaires are able to own more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country.
There should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c

It's unfortunate but not surprising that Biden‚Äôs polling firm is helping distort Medicare for All.

It's time to do the same with health care. We will pass Medicare for All so no one will be afraid to call an ambulance due to the cost.

Because of GM's outrageous greed, 49,000 workers went on strike. So GM cut off their health benefits.

2020 praise from @AaronDFordNV comes today to @BernieSanders, for his new housing plan

"I appreciate Senator Sanders offering bold solutions to address the housing crisis here in Nevada and nationwide." https://t.co/KgkJohd0ue
"We need a #HomesGuarantee." @BernieSanders

This historic, grassroots-sourced plan includes:
üí•Millions of social homes
üí•Massive reinvestment in public housing
üí•National rent control
üí•Decarbonization 
üí•Commitment to END homelessness

A better world is within reach.
The climate crisis will affect every area of our lives, including housing. Guaranteeing green, affordable housing as a right through the Green New Deal is not only morally necessary, it is overwhelmingly popular with the American people. #HousingForAll https://t.co/ZmV9AD4M4H
We are all thinking of Ady today. Thank you for never backing down in the fight to guarantee health care to all people. https://t.co/11zp9UWTis
My parents never made much money, but we kept a roof over our heads because we lived in a rent-controlled apartment.

Landlords cannot be allowed to raise rents to whatever they want, whenever they want.

We need national rent control. #HousingForAll
üòÆ 

@BernieSanders housing plan directs $50 billion to community land trusts.

And lots, lots more. Like $1.48 trillion (trillion!) over 10 years to the National Housing Trust Fund. #OurHomesOurVotes2020 https://t.co/fy0k7GZNJS
This is the richest country in the history of the world. No one in America should be homeless. #HousingForAll
New: Bernie Sanders has announced his "Housing for All" plan this a.m. In it, Sanders is proposing a national rent cap of 3% or 1.5 times the CPI to "prevent the exploitation of tenants." https://t.co/kcmPgYj4QH
"We need a homes guarantee." -@BernieSanders 

üè†Nearly 10 million homes through the NHTF, social housing, Community Land Trusts, and other housing programs
üè†Section 8 for everyone who qualifies
üè†End homelessness
üè†National rent control
And so much more https://t.co/uY4mTvujlG
Another day, another bold housing plan from a leading presidential candidate! Thank you @BernieSanders for laying out your vision to end homelessness and housing poverty. #OurHomesOurVotes2020 https://t.co/VDLUdxp49K
There are 3,000+ counties in the United States. A minimum wage worker can afford to rent a one-bedroom home in just 28 of them.

That is a national crisis.

My #HousingForAll plan will build the nearly 10 million new housing units our nation needs to guarantee housing as a right.
New: @BernieSanders unveils $2.5 trillion "Housing for All" plan to "guarantee every American... a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home," including:

- Building 10 million homes
- Investing $410 billion into Section 8
- Enacting 3% rent increase cap
This plan will have an outsized effect in CA, where the twin crises of affordability and homelessness have reached a breaking point: nearly 130,000 people are experiencing homelessness and renters need to earn $34.69 per hour to afford the average two-bedroom apartment. https://t.co/6DRvLMY4de

1/3 Was reading all the Presidential candidates platforms on affordable housing/rent control + listening to @BernieSanders most recent comments - he is spot on. I‚Äôm thankful that he is elevating the conversation around rent control at the federal level at this point in time cont.
If you can't afford to take care of your veterans, then don't go to war.
So many of my constituents have lost homes- even gone homeless- by unfair rent hikes. But Texas bans local rent control. That's why it‚Äôs so important that @BernieSanders just announced his plan for national rent control to override special interests &amp; protect millions of renters.
In the United States of America, one job should be enough to earn a decent living.

We must treat undocumented people with dignity. When we are in the White House, we will end the ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all across this country and impose a moratorium on deportations.

The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.
Supreme Court justices are not above the law. Someone who sits in judgment over the nation should have the highest integrity.
As a federal judge who overwhelmingly sided with corporate power and Wall Street, Brett Kavanaugh should never have been nominated.
At a time when their behavior is literally killing people, America needs a president who isn‚Äôt going to appease and compliment drug companies.

Wall Street got a multi-trillion dollar bailout with no strings attached, but the federal government did virtually nothing to help struggling Americans keep their homes.

We must envision a new form of American engagement: one in which we lead not in war-making but in finding shared solutions to shared global challenges. U.S. power should be measured not by our ability to blow things up, but to bring people together around our common humanity.
This endless war has damaged America's global standing. It has scarred a generation. It has corroded our politics. It has cost American taxpayers nearly $6 trillion. And it has produced more terrorists. We must end this endless war.
Instead of staying focused on those who attacked us, the Bush administration chose to declare a global ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù in order justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. The war on terror has turned into an endless war.
In the nearly two decades since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States has made a series of costly blunders that have not only weakened our democracy but also undermined our leadership.
Today, we remember the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the bravery of first responders who put their lives at risk to save others.

Imagine what your life would be like if your health care was guaranteed, your wages were fair, and an emergency wouldn't mean bankruptcy.

What if you weren't up at night worrying about taking care of your family?

All Americans deserve to feel that security, not just the rich.
I have never been able to accept that the United States, the richest country on Earth, does not guarantee health care to all its people. I will not stop fighting until we guarantee health care ‚Äì with no co-pays or deductibles ‚Äì for all. https://t.co/RYKL7PUhjv

Trump's economy means massive amounts of wealth goes to the top 1% and huge corporations, while working people need 2 or 3 jobs to get by.

I don't believe that's what America is about.

We'll create an economy that works for all people and make the wealthy pay their fair share.

Worth remembering that it was @BernieSanders who in 2016 debate was the first legit candidate to say that climate change was the greatest threat facing the world. Props to him for leading, and to others for figuring out he was right. That's how organizing is supposed to work.
Maybe, just maybe, instead of spending more than $1.5 trillion a year on weapons of destruction to kill each other, nations around the world can work together against our common enemy of climate change. #ClimateTownHall

Medicare for All is about more benefits, less costs, coverage for everyone, and more jobs. It‚Äôs that simple! @BernieSanders https://t.co/p47DSMJiCl
I don‚Äôt know how many times I have to say it, but I‚Äôll keep saying it until it happens:

1) All people must have a right to health care
2) Insurance companies shouldn't be able to make huge profits off of people's suffering

At least 500,000 Americans go bankrupt every year because of medical expenses‚Äîand the actual number is probably more like 750,000.

Senator McConnell has blocked gun safety legislation, he has blocked legislation to protect pensions, and he has blocked legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Yet he had no issue bringing forth legislation to throw 32 million Americans off their health insurance.
Sen. Mitch McConnell receives huge campaign contributions from:
- Wall Street
- Health insurance companies
- Drug companies
- The fossil fuel industry
- The NRA

It‚Äôs time for McConnell to start listening to working people, not his wealthy campaign contributors. https://t.co/l4zD0iGXWo
Coal miners have seen their pensions cut and benefits slashed. Their communities have been destroyed while fossil fuel CEOs get richer.

Here is my promise. A Sanders administration will not abandon communities left behind by the fossil fuel industry ‚Äî we will rebuild them.
We stand with the coal miners in Harlan County who aren‚Äôt receiving a paycheck.

I say to Senator McConnell: Do not turn your back on these communities. Ensure these workers get paid as soon as possible.
Mitch McConnell: You need to explain to the people of Kentucky why you believe that we should do nothing to stop Russia from interfering with our elections. Stop obstructing legislation to protect our democracy.
How many more Americans have to die in mass shootings before Senator McConnell has the guts to stand up to the NRA and pass meaningful gun safety legislation?
Over 500,000 workers in Kentucky make less than $15 an hour.

@senatemajldr: Why don't they deserve an average raise of $4,300 a year?

Stop blocking legislation to raise the current starvation minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour.
I say to Sen. Mitch McConnell: stop worrying about your billionaire friends ‚Äì they‚Äôre doing just fine.

If there ever was a time to think big, not small, it is right now when we are fighting for the survival of the planet. That is what the #GreenNewDeal is about.

We need to cancel student debt.

We need to make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free.
Tens of thousands of Americans die every year because they lack decent health insurance. There is no middle ground when it comes to heath care. We must guarantee affordable health care to every American through Medicare for All.

There is not justice when black women in America are making 61 cents on the dollar of what white men make. We have to adopt Equal Pay for Equal Work through the Paycheck Fairness Act. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay
Mr. Trump, you are not going to have a second term. https://t.co/cgmV6tRqPm
Coal miners are not our enemy.

Oil rig workers are not our enemy.

They are seeing their jobs slashed and communities destroyed while fossil fuel CEOs get richer.

That is why the #GreenNewDeal invests in a just transition for all workers and communities.
TONIGHT: Tune in as @BernieSanders joins @chrislhayes at 8pm ET. #inners https://t.co/5672MqaGg8
Don‚Äôt forget that these fires are being used to violently remove indigenous peoples from their land. Climate change is caused by profit-driven colonialism. We must hold these heartless industrialists to account for their atrocities. @BernieSanders‚Äôs #GreenNewDeal does it. https://t.co/74UpjhUTs9
Fossil fuel profits are not more important than the future of the planet. #GreenNewDeal
Today is #BlackWomensEqualPayDay which highlights the hard fact that Black Women in America have to work 599 days to make what white men get in 365 days. Black Women are paid 39% less than their white male counterparts. This is true in every industry. Hollywood included. https://t.co/wvpq9xJmVG
Unlike Trump we recognize climate change as the existential threat it is, not call it a hoax. We will create 20 million of jobs by radically transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy and averting the climate crisis. J https://t.co/59OFEGiRIn
"Sanders plan distinguishes itself in how aggressively it targets the fossil fuel industry. Not only does it call for hiking up taxes and penalties on polluters, it taps the Justice Department to pursue litigation against them." https://t.co/CuQa9dvL2F
Exactly. @SenSanders has massively moved the goal posts. This is what it means to treat the climate crisis like a true emergency and build an economy that cares for people and Earth at the same time. We can do this. We just have to choose to do. Read the plan, imagine its future. https://t.co/VGlbnQKCoY
@BernieSanders Specifics that will affect our gente in PR:

‚úÖEnsure a hunger-free transition

‚úÖEnsure FEMA protects community cohesion

‚úÖBuild resilient renewable electrical grid

‚úÖEnsure a just-transition to economic development with a Justice Resiliency Fund
#GreenNewDeal
Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused. #GreenNewDeal

We are going to end the greed of the fossil fuel industry and move to 100% renewable energy. #GreenNewDeal https://t.co/jEFCpt9NHQ
In 5 days, Bernie has released the 3 strongest plans to:

‚úÖEnd mass incarceration &amp; enact real criminal justice
‚úÖExpand, strengthen &amp; double union membership
‚úÖSave the planet &amp; create 20 million jobs

And we're just getting warmed up folks. #NotMeUs https://t.co/gwS6xW723O

Thank you to Sanders for forcefully standing up to the fossil fuel industry.

Fossil fuel executives knew decades ago that climate change was real yet funded denialism.

The #GreenNewDeal holds them fully accountable by:
-Ending ALL subsidies to the fossil fuel industry
-Making them pay for their pollution
-Suing and prosecuting them for damage they caused
@BernieSanders @TomSteyer @KamalaHarris @AOC #28 The climate plan that @BernieSanders just released is remarkable--it shows what simply must be done to meet the challenge physics has laid out. (And it would save a  fortune by helping to keep heating under some kind of control) #demunitytwitterproject

https://t.co/gLpwPeaOhL
The climate crisis is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It's also our single greatest opportunity to build a just and equitable future.

If federal workers had the right to strike none of us would have been subjected to that reckless, mean-spirited Shutdown - and lockout of another million people doing contract work - that put all of us and our entire economy in danger.

Congratulations to @JayInslee on his impactful campaign to bring the climate crisis to the forefront of the national conversation. There is no more important issue facing humanity. Together we will work to pass a Green New Deal and create millions of jobs.

The middle class is disappearing, the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, and Trump is making it worse.

We need to fundamentally overhaul our immigration system to treat those seeking asylum with humanity and dignity. When we are in the White House, on day one I will undo everything Trump has done to demonize and harm immigrants.
Trump's immigration agenda is cruel, racist and a stain on this nation. America cannot be about locking up families, including children, at the border indefinitely. https://t.co/vnlXmTI5Le
If there is going to be class warfare in this country, it's about time the working class won that war.
We will make it easier, not harder, for workers to join unions by implementing my Workplace Democracy Plan and establishing a national goal to double union membership. Join me now at the Iowa AFL-CIO Convention: https://t.co/OUs7pdKfpu
Democracy doesn‚Äôt just mean the chance to vote. It means control over your life.

To be a truly democratic society, we must create an economy where workers feel that they‚Äôre not just a cog in the machine, but that they have power over their jobs and workplaces.
NEW: @BernieSanders is out with a sweeping plan to revitalize organized labor, hoping to double union membership during his first term in office.

‚úÖGives workers the right to strike
‚úÖProvides workers the freedom to negotiate
‚úÖRaises wages across industries
‚úÖProtects pensions
‚úÖEnds contracts to union busters
‚úÖEnds "right to work" https://t.co/dBCq7JW1kL
Agree. No worker should be forced to continue working without a paycheck. https://t.co/nXOpf6BxaW
Great to see @BernieSanders' strong plan to overhaul our defective &amp; outdated labor laws. This proposal is the latest sign #2020 candidates can't ignore millions of workers demanding leaders rewrite the rules so everyone can join a union, no matter where we work #UnionsForAll
In December Trump shut down the government for 35 days, depriving over 800,000 workers of pay and forcing many to work without pay.

That cannot happen again.

Federal employees must be guaranteed the same rights as workers in the private sector‚Äîincluding the right to strike.
Right now, your taxpayer dollars subsidize giant CEO pay packages as well as corporate efforts to bust unions &amp; offshore jobs. 

With the stroke of a pen, President @BernieSanders is going to end that. https://t.co/sQRVoC0yi0
It would be hard for unions to dream up a better friend in the White House than @BernieSanders, who has tirelessly stood with the labor movement throughout his entire career. https://t.co/Ua6Z3RdatG

‚úÖ End "right to work"

Eric Garner and too many others should be alive today.

Violence and brutality of any kind at the hands of the police is unacceptable and will not be tolerated when we are in the White House.

Read the rest of my plan here: 7/7 https://t.co/BmKk9iNRgs
Police forces should not look and act like invading armies. We must demilitarize our police forces and establish federal standards for the use of body cameras. 6/
We will end harmful policing practices like racial profiling, stop and frisk, and oppressive ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù policing ‚Äì all of which actively undermine public safety and community trust in law enforcement. 5/
We will revitalize the use of Justice Department investigations, consent decrees, and federal lawsuits to address systemic constitutional violations by police departments. 4/
We will conduct a U.S. Attorney General‚Äôs investigation for ALL deaths involving the police and those in custody, establish civilian oversight of police departments, and create federal registries for police use of deadly force and misconduct. 3/
When we are in the White House we will mandate criminal liability for civil rights violations resulting from police misconduct, and limit ‚Äúqualified immunity‚Äù for police officers.

We will establish a national use of force standard that emphasizes de-escalation. 2/
The officer who killed Eric Garner has been fired. That is not enough.

We have got to change how police departments operate,  finally end police brutality and stop the killing of unarmed black and brown Americans.

Here are some of the ways I plan to do that as president: 1/
We need real criminal justice reform on a national level. Bernie laid out a vision that will get us there. https://t.co/0b3MGu14lD
This is the right decision, but we are still a very long way from achieving justice for Eric Garner‚Äôs family and countless others who have lost loved ones to police violence. We must fundamentally transform our criminal justice system at every level. https://t.co/1YVNtpNfrj

Solitary confinement is a form of torture. It is unconstitutional, plain and simple. We must end solitary confinement in America.
Cardi B is exactly right: We've seen too many images of unarmed black men killed by police.

The death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.

It is applied disproportionately to people of color.

It has been proven not to deter violent crime.

The United States must join almost every other advanced country on Earth and abolish the death penalty.
Bernie's criminal justice plan will:

‚úÖBan for-profit prisons
‚úÖEnd Cash bail
‚úÖAbolish the death penalty
‚úÖEnd mandatory minimums
‚úÖEnd three strikes laws
‚úÖLegalize marijuana
‚úÖEnd solitary confinement
‚úÖDecriminalize truancy for youth &amp; their parents

https://t.co/Y8G0FtW24N

I'm proud to announce our Justice and Safety for All plan to reform America‚Äôs dysfunctional criminal justice system. https://t.co/sZBOzSy9Td
The criminal justice system must treat children as children.

No more children under age 18 tried in adult courts.

No more long mandatory minimum sentences for children.

No more criminalizing truancy.

No more juveniles housed in adult prisons.
Black students, even in preschool, are nearly four times as likely to be suspended as white students.

We are going to end the school-to-prison pipeline. Read my plan to do that and end mass incarceration in America:

We must legalize marijuana nationally, expunge past marijuana convictions and ensure revenue from legal marijuana is reinvested in the communities most impacted by the failed War on Drugs.
No one should be able to profit from filling our prisons.

Not only must we ban private prisons, we must make phone calls and other communication free of charge and end police departments‚Äô reliance on fines and fees for revenue.
We spend $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people, more than any country on Earth.

That is outrageous.

As president my goal will be to cut the incarcerated population in half.
Bernie's plan "aims to cut the nation‚Äôs prison population in half, end mandatory minimum sentencing, ban private prisons and legalize marijuana. He says the current system does not fairly treat people of color, addicts or the mentally ill." https://t.co/uYU9kHHEy0

Anyone who does not understand the urgency of the climate crisis and plans to respond accordingly needs to get out of politics right now.
Thanks for the pizza, @BernieSanders! #NoPayWeStay #WeCantWait https://t.co/zoXEjWklGo
For spending over 2.5x as much per capita on health care as the average developed country, you would think we would have the best health outcomes in the world.

Our corporate-run health care system is failing our people. It's time for Medicare for All. https://t.co/2zSxpIsYZ0

This is the message that can win the 2020 election üëá https://t.co/lQeNz67Zui
We are not only taking on Donald Trump.

We are not only taking on our primary opponents.

We are taking on the health insurance and drug companies, the military and prison industrial complexes, the fossil fuel industry and more.

But if we stick together, we are going to win.
Climate change is a national emergency.
Anti-Semitism is not some abstract idea to me. It is very personal. It destroyed a good part of my family. I absolutely reject Trump's disgusting efforts to exploit fear of anti-Semitism to attack my colleagues. https://t.co/IwpSmxcnHF
In the last three decades the top 1% increased its net worth by $21 trillion.

The bottom 50% of Americans lost $900 billion.

We should be treating our inequality crisis as an emergency‚Äîbecause it is one.
The reason we need Medicare for All boils down to this:

The point of a health care system should be to keep people alive and healthy‚Äînot to make billions of dollars in profits for greedy health insurance companies.
We need a president who will do everything in their power to raise wages for working people.

That is exactly what I plan to do, including raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and raising starting pay for teachers to $60,000 a year.
I find it strange that Republicans claim their policies are good for the economy, yet they oppose the Green New Deal, which would create millions of good-paying jobs for Americans.

If we are going to support workers and create jobs, we need to forcefully address climate change.
Spoiler Alert:
Bernie does not get his nails done.

He does, however, show that he is the candidate that will defeat Donald Trump.

For far too long, the billionaire class has been able to buy our elections by supporting candidates who will continue business as usual. The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. 

That ends when we are in the White House.
Bernie has been saying this over and over again. Because he fight for working people I support Bernie Sanders. @BernieSanders @Latinos4Bernie https://t.co/pjAG9iaXWb
We‚Äôve said from the start that we will have to take on virtually the entire media establishment in this campaign, and so far that has proven to be true.

Ok. Fine. We are ready. https://t.co/1G8ebUCTV3
The reason working people are struggling is not because of immigrants, like Trump wants people to believe. 

It is because Trump and his billionaire friends have rigged our economy to ensure the rich get richer and everyone else gets poorer. https://t.co/oSv2PO9arh
Donald Trump has fueled a climate which emboldens violent extremists and where immigrants live in constant fear. We are going to defeat him and his bigotry. https://t.co/J6s29hW0jR

Every American, regardless of income, is entitled to:

The right to a decent job that pays a living wage.
The right to quality health care.
The right to a complete education.
The right to affordable housing.
The right to a clean environment.
The right to a secure retirement.
Tens of thousands of Americans die each year because they lack health insurance.

Meanwhile the private health care industry made $100 billion in profits last year.

Greed is the business model of our health care system today and it is killing Americans.

I have a simple question for the health care industry:

Why do you believe it is more important to spend millions on advertising, lobbying and campaign contributions than it is to make sure that no one dies or goes bankrupt because they cannot afford health care?
I do not think it is unreasonable to say that you should be able to go to the store without the fear of being gunned down.

We can and we will end the epidemic of gun violence in this country.
Today I asked the health care industry a simple question:

How much will you spend to defeat Medicare for All?

Is it $200 million? Is it $500 million?

They can spend all the money they want. We're going to beat them. https://t.co/cjjCVbOBsc

If you truly want to be bipartisan, ask McConnell to call the Senate back into session and pass gun safety legislation that Americans are demanding.
We have a president who actively demonizes racial and religious minorities, who coddles Nazis and Klansmen, and who wields white supremacy as a political weapon. https://t.co/CSKqZDgcFd
We need leadership in this country that is unequivocal in condemning violence and hatred.

Seeing an American president describe people marching under a swastika as ‚Äúgood people‚Äù fills me with anger and disgust. But that anger has to be channeled into nonviolent political action.
We have got to come together as a nation and combat the rise of violent white supremacist extremism.

That means redirecting federal resources to address this threat to our national security.
We need to ban the manufacture, sale and transfer of weapons of war. Period.

We have got to implement a buyback program to get these weapons off the streets.

And we have got to regulate assault weapons in the same way that we currently regulate fully automatic weapons.
Over this past week our country has experienced multiple, unimaginable tragedies using weapons of war.

These are terrorist acts of war, and we need a national response. https://t.co/4NN0Gbz7xO
Democrats, Republicans, Independents and even gun owners agree, ENOUGH is ENOUGH. It is time to stand up to the NRA and take action to make our communities safer from gun violence.

There are more than 5 million assault weapons out on the streets of America, which is more than the U.S. military has. That is insane. We must ban the sale, distribution and transfer of assault weapons in the United States.

If you have had ENOUGH of the epidemic levels of gun violence in this country, consider making a donation to @GiffordsCourage, one of the organizations leading the fight to change our gun laws:  https://t.co/DHdacDzLMl
Mitch McConnell should bring the Senate back into session immediately to pass HR 8, the gun safety bill that has already passed the House. That's a first step to addressing our serious gun violence epidemic.
We must treat this violent racism like the security threat that it is. That means investing in law enforcement resources to combat the growing population of white nationalists who are engaging in violence. 4/4
We must come together to reject this dangerous and growing culture of bigotry espoused by Trump and his allies. 

Instead of wasting money putting children in cages, we must seriously address the scourge of violent bigotry and domestic terrorism. 3/
After every tragedy the Senate, intimidated by the NRA‚Äôs power, does nothing. This must change.

We need a president and congress that listen to Americans, not the ideology of a right-wing extremist organization.

We cannot continue to allow private health insurance companies to make massive profits by denying care to those that need it. That is fundamentally immoral and that is why we need Medicare for All.
Why does Trump continue to use racism, bigotry and xenophobia to divide us?

Because he can only win when the people of this country turn against each other.

We are much more powerful than him, and the rest of the billionaire class, when we are united.
Greed is the religion of the billionaire class. And a nation based on greed will not survive morally, economically or politically.

This family was able to save $10,000 buying insulin for their son in Canada, where the exact same insulin is one-tenth the price.

@BernieSanders @People4Bernie @OFB2020 @andyg_live @SenSanders Hunter Sego started rationing his insulin when he found out his parents were sacrificing water &amp; food to pay for his insulin.

This vial of insulin costs just $6 to manufacture.

At this pharmacy in Windsor, Ontario, it can be purchased for $32. Twenty minutes away, in Detroit, the same exact vial costs $340.

@BernieSanders Incredibly emotional moment in Canada: "Today I saved $10,000. $1000 got me 6 months of insulin for my son. I paid $1000, that's less than we pay a month in the United States. How can we be the greatest country and I am paying that much?" #Insulin4all https://t.co/qJJjv5PUL0

Three drug companies control 90 percent of the insulin market, and year after year they raise the price of insulin at the same levels.

I will appoint an Attorney General who will enforce our antitrust laws, and executives caught engaging in price-fixing will go to jail.
"Three drug companies made $14.5 billion in profit last year, control 90% of the insulin in this country, it's just an amazing coincidence prices go up and and up and up, so what you do is you throw these people in jail if they engage in price fixing" @BernieSanders #Insulin4all https://t.co/Upaqe18gam

Every person with a disability deserves the right to live in the community and have the services and supports they need to pursue the American Dream. This right must be available to all, free of waiting lists and means tests. It is our moral responsibility to make it happen.
We must guarantee people with disabilities the right to live in the community; truly integrated employment that pays a living wage; affordable, accessible housing; and the right to health care, including mental health care and home and community based services and supports.
Today, as we commemorate the 29th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, we must recommit to championing the rights of people with disabilities. As a nation, we have a moral responsibility to ensure that all people with disabilities have their rights protected.

Please take 3 mins to hear @amy4thepeople's story. She went through what no parent should ever have to go through b/c her daughter didn't have healthcare.

While I'm very proud of the work we did to pass a War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support for the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen, we must reverse the disastrous policies that got us here in the first place. When we are in the White House, we will do this on Day 1. (3/3)

Medicare for All critics expect us to believe that people love paying their insurance premiums. Is that a joke? https://t.co/yYnuTrKZuZ
Trump promised he would lower drug prices. That was a monstrous lie. As president, he has:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è nominated an HHS Secretary directly from Eli Lilly
‚ñ∂Ô∏è given $7 billion in tax cuts to the four biggest drugmakers
‚ñ∂Ô∏è tried to throw 32 million off of their health coverage https://t.co/wI1pfO04K4
Trump said he would stand up to Big Pharma.

He lied.

Trump said he would bring relief to Americans dealing with outrageous drug prices.

He lied.

Trump said he would guarantee "insurance for everybody."

He lied.

We need to cut drug prices by 50%, not more lies.

There‚Äôs nothing "extreme" about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

What‚Äôs extreme is paying workers starvation wages while CEO pay and corporate profits skyrocket.

I say to @senatemajldr McConnell: do what the American people want. Hold a vote on the Senate floor to pass a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/qN0s3K6mvp
Today is historic.

A few years ago, people laughed and called us "crazy" when we called to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Today, the U.S. House is voting on legislation to do just that.

That is what happens when working people build a movement for change.
Trump knows that when we stand together and fight for racial, social, economic and environmental justice, we have the power to defeat him.

So the demagogue is doing what he knows best: Divide and conquer through hate.

His attacks only make us stronger. #IStandWithIlhan

Despite what you're hearing about Medicare being "weakened," the opposite is true. #MedicareForAll will EXPAND benefits to seniors to include hearing aids, dental care and eyeglasses.
I am with @BernieSanders- #MedicareForAll 

It's a disgrace that our country, the richest nation in the world, allows our our family, our friends, &amp; our community members to suffer and/or die needless deaths for the sake of profits &amp; a lack of political courage.

#NoMiddleGround https://t.co/XPaerXdCnk
The US can absolutely afford #MedicareForAll. It won‚Äôt happen magically but it will indeed happen if we demand it. In the ballot box and in the streets. You deserve it. Your family deserves it. And even if you‚Äôre looking at it just from a financial standpoint, we can afford it.
.@BernieSanders just called on every 2020 Democratic candidate to reject contributions from the health care industry that exceed $250! and if they can‚Äôt, they have some explai I g to do! HELLO!! #Bernie2020 #Medicare4 https://t.co/kXr66Zc6Vo
No more premiums.
No more deductibles.
No more co-payments.

That is what #MedicareForAll means for the American people.
My Republican friends‚Äîand others‚Äîseem to think that Americans hate paying taxes but love premiums.

Who in America is saying ‚ÄúThe insurance premium is here, what a wonderful day! Oh wow! Let‚Äôs celebrate!‚Äù?

The answer: Nobody. https://t.co/He1Ad4ZCRZ
.@BernieSanders explains how #MedicareForAll EXPANDS the program. Anyone with questions, here are your answers. https://t.co/YW1E4OxOLX
"#MedicareForAll allows people the freedom to chose any doctor, any clinic, or any hospital without worrying about if their provider is in network or not." - @BernieSanders
‚ÄúI feel pretty stressed about health insurance all the time.‚Äù

It's time to get insurers out of the #healthcare equation -- it's time for #MedicareForAll!

https://t.co/z2RM8Dt4TZ
In order to defeat #MedicareForAll, powerful special interests will spend millions on ads and corporate-sponsored ‚Äústudies‚Äù to frighten the American people. That is exactly what happened before the passage of Medicare in the 1960s.

They failed then and they‚Äôre going to fail now.
I pledge to not take contributions from the health insurance or pharmaceutical industry and instead prioritize the health of the American people over health industry profits. https://t.co/ZMNLG6D1Bw
The current debate over #MedicareForAll really has nothing to do with health care.

It has everything to do with greed.

The health care industry wants to maintain a system which makes them billions every year, and bribe politicians who protect that system.
"Current debate over Medicare for all has nothing to do with healthcare and everything to do with greed and profits of healthcare industry." -@BernieSanders #MedicareForAll address
"The function of a rational health care system is to provide health care to all in a cost effective way - not to make billions in profit for insurance and drug companies." - @BernieSanders #MedicareForAll
No Premiums 
No Co-pays
No Deductibles 
Medicare for All!

@BernieSanders today at George Washington University #MedicareForAll https://t.co/foSPm3cYJ9
This is the United States of America.

30,000 people a year should not be dying because they lack adequate health insurance.

#MedicareForAll
Frankly, I am sick and tired of talking to doctors who tell me about the patients who died because they were uninsured and walked into the doctor‚Äôs office when it was too late. #MedicareForAll
I pledge to not take contributions from the health insurance or pharmaceutical industry and instead prioritize the health of the American people over health industry profits. https://t.co/ZMNLG6D1Bw
Some have described Medicare for All as too "risky."

Here's what is risky: leaving tens of millions of Americans without health insurance every year, facing bankruptcy or death if they can't pay for health care or medication they need.
If you‚Äôre a pharmaceutical executive, or a health insurance lobbyist, keep your money. I don‚Äôt want it.

What I want is for every person in this country to have the dignity of being able to get the medical care they need, when they need it. I want #MedicareForAll.
We have a president today who is a racist. That needs to be said. https://t.co/ZDnzmP1pTa
Joe Biden said people would lose coverage if we move to #MedicareForAll. That is absurd. https://t.co/qAmOBbRk9J
Eric Garner was killed 5 years ago. The officer who killed him is still on the force. That is unacceptable.
Insurance and drug companies have rigged our system to make as much profit as possible.

Meanwhile, 34 million Americans are uninsured and millions more can't afford care.

Here‚Äôs my pledge: I won't take contributions from health insurance or drug companies. #MedicareForAll
The health insurance industry is terrified of #MedicareForAll.

Why?

Because it will finally free Americans from the greed of health insurance companies more interested in making huge profits than guaranteeing all people health care. https://t.co/jK9pIt2v74
Candidates who are not willing to reject money from health insurance and pharmaceutical executives should explain to the American people why those interests believe their campaigns are a good investment. #MedicareForAll https://t.co/Ne0hGI9Fuh

No worker should be told they're lucky to get less than minimum wage. People with disabilities deserve jobs that pay a living wage. It's time to end the subminimum wage and guarantee truly integrated employment opportunities for people with disabilities. https://t.co/km72xDjJW9
This is the question we face as a nation:

Will we continue to let corporations make huge profits off health care and human suffering? Or will we end that disgrace and guarantee coverage to everyone through Medicare for All?

To me, that is not a hard decision.

While tens of millions of Americans today are uninsured, millions more are underinsured. Have you been unable to get or afford medical care you needed even though you have private insurance?

We cannot continue to tinker around the edges while 80 million Americans lack health insurance or are under-insured.

Over four years we will transition to a system in which Medicare is expanded to cover everyone with no copays, deductibles or premiums.

Lloyd Blankfein said Goldman Sachs does ‚Äúgod‚Äôs work.‚Äù 

Is that what he called it when Goldman Sachs made millions pumping up the cost of food for starving people across the world?
https://t.co/h4P1OA6KcM
Lloyd Blankfein owned not one but TWO mansions in the Hamptons.

How? Goldman Sachs lying to investors and profiting from millions of Americans losing their homes in an "unbelievable fraud."
After being bailed out by taxpayers, Lloyd Blankfein lectured Congress to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits and raise the retirement age for working people.
Because of the greed of banks like Goldman Sachs, Americans lost $13 trillion in savings.
 
When Blankfein retired from Goldman Sachs, he received a $50 million retirement package.
During the Wall Street crash an estimated 15 million families lost their homes.
 
Lloyd Blankfein didn't lose his home or his job. 

His bank got an $824 billion taxpayer bailout and Blankfein became a billionaire.
I played a small part in this video. I'm so honored to fight for my community and work for @BernieSanders. https://t.co/mkUqAxQnJA

Honestly, I cannot remember Big Pharma ever losing a major legislative battle. They win, the American people lose. That ends when we are in the White House.
H√©ctor Figueroa was a prime example of strength in the labor movement. His legacy amongst some of the hardest working, and yet overlooked workers, will live on forever with the countless security officers and service sector workers he helped lift into the middle class. https://t.co/BVJzO9FAui

Do you want to know why we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? It might have something to do with the fact that the pharmaceutical industry spends endless amounts of money on lobbying and campaign contributions.

The ‚ÄúIndustry Recognized Apprenticeship Programs‚Äù being pushed by @MickMulvaneyOMB will prioritize poor training standards and increased work pace over the safety of workers and the public, and they will put quality facilities like those of the @GoIUPAT at risk.
We need job training that focuses on long-term quality, safety and longevity ‚Äì not on short-term profits and hastiness. I am pleased to see unions like @GoIUPAT bring attention to the misguided @USDOL apprenticeships rule change.

Bottom line: no one should profit off illness and suffering. That's why we need #MedicareForAll.
Yes, we have a proposal to cut prescription drug prices in half. But we also have something else even more important.

We have the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry and end their greed. https://t.co/VfWmljAbAg

This is the wealthiest nation in the world and there is no reason we cannot do the same. #MedicareForAll

Are you truly free if you:

-Must ration prescriptions because they're too expensive?
-Drown in medical debt for years?

Medicare for All means freedom from the greed of the private insurance industry which is destroying lives.

It is imperative that we remain steadfast in our commitment to guarantee health care as a human right and no longer allow private corporations to make billions of dollars in profits off Americans‚Äô health care.
If you support Medicare for All, you must be willing to end the greed of the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries. That means transforming our dysfunctional system by ending the use of private health insurance, except to cover non-essential care like cosmetic surgeries.

Student loans are a scam.

That‚Äôs why I join @BernieSanders, @RepJayapal &amp; @IlhanMN to forgive ALL student loans AND make colleges tuition-free.

PS: for the cost of the GOP tax scam (~$2 TRILLION), we could‚Äôve already forgiven every student loan in America w/ billions left over. https://t.co/GXRHHWoKai
Wall Street speculators nearly destroyed the economy a decade ago, and the American people bailed them out.

Now it's time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class of this country.

We are going to #CancelStudentDebt and pay for it with a tax on Wall Street.
It‚Äôs time to bail out the people! #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/F8W7reQUuB
Are you truly free if you graduate hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt?

Are you free if you cannot pursue your dream because you don't make enough to cover your student loan payments?

We will #CancelStudentDebt because there is no freedom without economic freedom.
Almost two-thirds of all student debt‚Äînearly $929 billion‚Äîin the U.S. is held by women. #CancelStudentDebt
I don't want my children to have to worry about whether or not they can afford to go to college, and I do not want them to have to sign decades of their lives away to a bank. 

It's a moral imperative for the future of our country's potential that we #CancelStudentDebt.
Why we need to #CancelStudentDebt 

- Black students graduate with some $7.4k more in student loans debt than white students

- 2/3s of all student loan debt is held by women

- The average college student graduates with $30k in student loans
Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump want to make it harder for young people to attend college and reward predatory lenders that keep students trapped in debt.

We have a better idea: make public colleges and universities tuition-free and cancel all student debt.

#CancelStudentDebt
16 yrs after graduation &amp; still have 26k student loan debt - pales in comparison to many new graduates.

Tuition is much higher now &amp; cost of living is also higher...only wages have stagnated. #CancelStudentDebt will help stimulate economic growth.

#CollegeForAll #Bernie2020 https://t.co/H8LZKAqkT5
This is why I‚Äôm all in for @BernieSanders 

#CancelStudentDebt #StrikeDebt

All $1.6 trillion. https://t.co/IlQw7Gr8Zv
Senator Sanders is NOT beholden to Wall Street and he NEVER will be. In fact, he's devoted his career to fighting Wall Streets's predatory abuses on our students. #CancelStudentDebt 

https://t.co/rmau0jwjmU
About 2 weeks ago, @BernieSanders explained his desire for a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights. See here: https://t.co/cHskLJu0yf

One plank was "the right to a complete education."

#CancelStudentDebt + tuition-free public college would move the nation in that direction.
50% of Californians in the class of 2017 graduated with student debt at an average of $22,785 in debt. 

That‚Äôs why @BernieSanders knows we need to #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/AjtM30Dw5M
Iowa has nearly $13 billion dollars worth of student debt. 

63% of our students graduate with  $30,000 of debt.

It‚Äôs time to #CancelStudentDebt 

It‚Äôs time for @BernieSanders 

#IACaucus #Bernie2020
This is what leadership looks like. #CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/XjwXfSvgGR
How much student debt do you have, and what would you be able to do if you didn't have it? #CancelStudentDebt
If we had cancelled all student debt in 2016, we would have shrunk the racial wealth gap between young white and black households (ages 25 to 40) from 12:1 to 5:1.

#CancelStudentDebt 
#CancelTheRacialWealthGap
Student debt can deter you from moving, marriage, children, buying a home, choosing a particular career, leaving an unhappy, unhealthy or dangerous situation and overall limits whatever you desire to do for a decade or so. Want an economic reboot? #CancelStudentDebt
Black students graduate with some $7,400 more in student loan debt than white students. Just four years after graduating, the debt gap widens to $25,000. #CancelStudentDebt
#CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/Kai02PE8XS
If we could bail out Wall Street, we sure as hell can #CancelStudentDebt.
#CancelStudentDebt https://t.co/UxKo9vxOxz
These responses from @BernieSanders represent a rare and important pushback by a major figure in our politics against the way in which the media uses empty language to diminish the significance of acts of war by presidents who disregard the Constitution.

https://t.co/JPirXZrni6
.@BernieSanders: ‚ÄúIn my view, the right to control your own body is a constitutional right ‚Äî and you will have a president who will defend that right vigorously in every way possible.‚Äù #WeDecide https://t.co/zkrew2K51P

Trump's immigration policies are sickening, disgusting and everything that this country does not stand for.

We need a humane policy at the border, not locking up children in cages.

We need to protect the 1.8 million eligible for DACA.

We need comprehensive immigration reform.
Americans are lining up in the middle of the night at temporary clinics, in parking lots and cafeterias, to get the health care they desperately need. That is an international disgrace. We must pass Medicare for All.
https://t.co/BtaP7RGzDX
Bombing another country is an act of warfare. Period. 

We must do everything possible to stop Donald Trump from escalating the crisis he helped create with Iran. https://t.co/xue0FUMOCq
We need a political revolution to transform this country.  Join us in South Carolina! https://t.co/pP78xqJ55P
The corporate wing of the party thinks we're an ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù because we want to:

-Make health care a right
-Break up big banks
-Save the planet
-Make college tuition-free
-End endless wars
-Make the wealthy pay their fair share

If that makes us a "threat,‚Äù so be it. https://t.co/UCZPh6FDcP
Live at the Planned Parenthood Forum https://t.co/ebhl5qkixs
I plead guilty to being an "existential threat" to the greed of corporate interests and wealthy campaign contributors who want to continue their dominance over the political and economic life of our country. https://t.co/r1wW4m9Ecr
A nation isn't judged by how many billionaires it has.

It is judged by how it treats children, the sick and the poor.

The cruelty of the Trump administration must end immediately. https://t.co/BH6YplweRw
It is true that the 1% have a lot of money and a lot of power. But 99% is a hell of a lot bigger number than 1%.
Mark my words. A war with Iran would be an unmitigated disaster.

I need your help to stop this disastrous war.

Sign our petition to tell Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit military action against Iran without Congressional approval. https://t.co/3544kmkO3P
This video about teachers‚Äô strikes shows one of the main reasons I support @BernieSanders. Could you take a peek? https://t.co/OKHRyRRkLA
‚ÄúBrothers and sisters, at the end of the day, the one percent - they‚Äôve got a lot of money and a lot of power,‚Äù @BernieSanders, getting s big crowd response. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve got something - 99 percent is a hell of a bigger number than one percent.‚Äù https://t.co/xkYyd5Uy19
At Jim Clyburn‚Äôs fish fry @BernieSanders takes the stage https://t.co/mQodZ6uKUx
The Constitution is very clear: it's Congress‚Äînot the president‚Äîwho decides when we go to war.

Congress must immediately make clear to Trump: he can't take us into hostilities with Iran without congressional authorization.

Doing so would be unconstitutional and illegal.

A war with Iran would be an absolute disaster.

-It would further destabilize the region
-It would result in never-ending war
-It would likely cost trillions of dollars
-Thousands of lives would be lost

We must not fight another unnecessary war. https://t.co/mP3mYRvsl0

When @BernieSanders says that climate change is the biggest threat to national security, he‚Äôs not alone. 

A new study finds that our warming climate will play a huge role in stoking violence and destabilizing nations. https://t.co/maLQT68jhU

On July 1st, an estimated 77,000 Nevadans will have their voting rights restored. Attorney General @AaronDFordNV is going to make sure they know about it. This is what state leadership in defense of our fundamental rights looks like.

If you are a human being, regardless of your immigration status, you have a right to health care. #MedicareForAll

@BernieSanders contesta preguntas en Telemundo luego de su presentaci√≥n en NALEO. Habl√≥ de una pol√≠tica p√∫blica sensible en la frontera, devolverle e status a 1.8 millones de estudiantes de DACA y sobre la salud y educaci√≥n como derechos. @Latinos4Bernie https://t.co/HQPnbdHyBM
"I make a simple promise to you: to protect the undocumented, to pass a comprehensive immigration reform, to reinstate legal status to DACA recipients," @BernieSanders at #NALEOMiami. https://t.co/iG5V8ofRNE https://t.co/oABM5YcEZb
@BernieSanders @NALEO Asking about whether undocumented get covered under Medicare For All, @BernieSanders tells @NALEO, "Absolutely. When I talk about health care being a human right, last time I heard -- undocumented people are human beings too!"
Here is my promise: As President I will:

‚úÖ protect the undocumented
‚úÖ pass comprehensive immigration reform
‚úÖ reinstate legal status for DACA recipients and their parents
Following President Trump‚Äôs announcement of plans for immigrant round-ups and deportations, @BernieSanders tackles the demonization of immigrants and dangerous rhetoric at #NALEOMiami: https://t.co/zJnfEfp7nU
"Vamos a usar todos los poderes de la presidencia para revertir el temor y el da√±o que este presidente ha hecho", asegur√≥ @BernieSanders en #NALEOMiami. https://t.co/OvUFRsW14J https://t.co/5GrcvkulG2
Thank you Senator @BernieSanders, I‚Äôm proud to be helping lead the fight for social and economic justice. We are going to finish what we started in 2016. A political revolution that will restore dignity back to the working class, and take back our democracy from the billionaires. https://t.co/piLTljpnvW
.@Walmart is owned by the richest family in America. The Waltons are worth over $175 billion.

They refuse to raise their workers' minimum wage to $15 an hour.

That is greed, plain and simple.
AT&amp;T promised to create 7,000 new jobs if the Trump tax cuts passed.

It got $21 billion in tax breaks, but has CUT 23,000 jobs and plans to cut nearly 2,000 more this year.

Working families at @ATT deserve better. I stand with them and @CWAunion. AT&amp;T's greed must end.
No one in America should die because they can't afford insulin. #MedicareForAll

.@Walmart got a $2.2 billion tax break from Trump. Now they are cutting hundreds of jobs and still refuse to pay a living wage.

I say to the Waltons: If you won't end your greed then we'll end it for you. https://t.co/a6RAuxfBXp
Special interests just launched a $4 million campaign to attack Medicare for All.

They want to protect the current system which makes huge profits for executives and leaves 34 million without care.

They may have the money. But we have the people. We're going to win.
I am beyond thrilled and honored to receive an endorsement from @BernieSanders. He has dedicated his entire career to achieving economic, racial, and social justice for all. 

Here in Queens, we are working toward that same goal ‚Äî on June 25th, we can take one giant leap forward. https://t.co/Mwl0wsALwp
I stand in solidarity with all those fighting for union representation in their workplace. To @peretti and @BuzzFeed: do the right thing and recognize the @bfnewsunion, negotiate in good faith, and agree on a fair contract. https://t.co/OelWt6i8Az
We cannot be a nation that is locking up little children at the border and tearing families apart. We must treat asylum seekers with dignity. https://t.co/d8Ny9r3yIe
Congratulations to @Facebook bike share workers. Together, we will grow the union movement and improve the lives of American workers. https://t.co/5XgMTdvdfM
This is why there is no middle ground when it comes to boldly addressing climate change, immediately. People are dying because of the greed of the fossil fuel industry. That is an international emergency. https://t.co/HinjJvESwl
It's easy for politicians to pound the table and talk about how tough they are.

But it will not be the kids of billionaires who get killed in a war with Iran. It will be working class kids.

We must work to solve this crisis with Iran diplomatically, not go to war.
Four years without a raise. No family health care coverage. A union-busting private contractor. It's no wonder why @ATUComm bus drivers on Martha's Vineyard are gearing up for a strike. My message to @VTA_MV: respect workers and settle a fair contract. https://t.co/ufQjNPq42d
Let's be clear: There's nothing patriotic about the wealthiest people in America stashing their cash in offshore tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes. If I'm elected president, we will end these offshore tax scams and make the top 1% pay their fair share. https://t.co/sJ4vXiVvGn
Billy Koehler died because he couldn't afford a defibrillator.

Shalynne Vilela died waiting for care due to her insurance status.

.@mrdannyglover is right: "Only by reaching high can you transform this country. You cannot meddle around the middle." https://t.co/HlcEnH812a
Bike share workers at @Facebook are fighting for economic improvements to secure their livelihoods. Tomorrow they will vote on whether to join a union. Unions work in improving the lives of workers. Good luck tomorrow.

When the people of Yemen see ‚ÄúMade in USA‚Äù on the bombs that are destroying their country, it tells them that the U.S.A. is to blame.

The Vietnam War was based on a lie. The Iraq War was based on lies. We cannot allow Trump to drag us into war with Iran. https://t.co/veS01nhKiW
I've committed to supporting the nominee. My question to @ThirdWayKessler and the corporate wing of the party: If we nominate a progressive who supports M4A, breaking up the big banks and taking on the billionaire class, whomever that is, will you support them against Trump?
I am pleased to endorse @CabanForQueens, who is running for District Attorney in Queens, New York. Like our campaign, Tiffany is taking on virtually the entire political establishment. And like our campaign, Tiffany has put together the kind of grassroots effort it takes to win. https://t.co/Vp5AH2ncAV
The cat is out of the bag. The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly "anybody but Bernie." They know our progressive agenda of Medicare for All, breaking up big banks, taking on drug companies and raising wages is the real threat to the billionaire class. https://t.co/zimci7JRO6
Juneteenth should be a national holiday. https://t.co/kMMMoMOuHp
In 2017, four of the Waltons made $12.7 billion in a single day.

To make that much, it would take a @Walmart worker working ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù earning $11 an hour over 653,000 years.

The greed has got to end.
Our most important job is to defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.
Things Trump didn‚Äôt mention in his campaign kickoff:

-Climate change
-Tens of millions live paycheck to paycheck
-$1.5 trillion student debt crisis
-Our infrastructure is crumbling
-Minimum wage hasn‚Äôt been raised in 10 years
-40,000 people die from gun violence each year
Trump is living in a parallel universe. He is way out of touch with ordinary people. He must be defeated.
Donald Trump just launched his 2020 campaign. This is how we will beat him. https://t.co/qfnqIsz1ad

Let me make a prediction. When he begins his re-election campaign tonight, Trump won't mention that he tried to throw 32 million off health care, or that he proposed massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security, or that he gave huge tax breaks to the top 1%. Just a guess.

You know how we could give 40 million people a raise?

Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in U.S. history. He is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe and a religious bigot. He betrayed the working class to further enrich the wealthy.

When you grow up poor in rural America it can feel like there is no way out.

@BernieSanders @GameWorkers Too often, workers in the entertainment industry are underpaid and overworked because they are so passionate about their crafts. By joining together and negotiating as a group, we can make our workplaces better. Thank you @SenSanders for speaking out on this important issue.

The massacre of congregants in their house of worship in Charleston was a reminder that for all of the progress made in recent years, our basic freedoms remain under attack in this country‚Äîand so often, the victims are people of color.
On the fourth anniversary of the attack on the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, we mourn the victims of this horrific killing‚Äîand we recommit ourselves to the fight against racism and all forms of bigotry.
The top 1% increased its net worth by $21 trillion from 1989-2018.

The bottom 50% lost $900 billion.

The fact is that our economy today is built for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer.
The fact that the United States continues to arrest hundreds of thousands of black and brown Americans every year for possession of marijuana, while wealthy investors on Wall Street make huge profits off of it, is completely outrageous.
We‚Äôre gearing up to fight for transformational change in Iowa with @BernieSanders! Here‚Äôs a snapshot of our weekend! https://t.co/hPWN3R55SO
For FOUR STRAIGHT YEARS @BernieSanders has beaten Trump in a head to head. He‚Äôs NEVER been down on him. Not once. Not in 2015. Not in 2016. And not now. 

Bernie can beat Trump. 
He will beat Trump. 

It‚Äôs one of my top reasons for supporting him. I know he will beat Trump. https://t.co/z1IGCGsmht
I completely agree ‚Äî and our grassroots campaign is fighting for that transformational change every single day. https://t.co/fgeKadYYBR
Our grandchildren will look back with shame on members of the Republican Party who ignored scientists and denied the crisis of climate change to protect fossil fuel profits.
This is why we fight for Medicare for All.

As long as we have a profit-driven health care system, there will be fathers like Scott who lose their children to the greed of insurance companies.

We will end this disgrace and make health care a right. https://t.co/hBkMiB83p7
Today marks the longest stretch in U.S. history that there has been no minimum wage increase‚Äî3,614 days.

I‚Äôve been criticized for this so let me say it again: the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr is a STARVATION wage. Every worker deserves a living wage of at least $15 an hour.
We have the best campaign to defeat Donald Trump. When we are in the White House we will fight for the working people of this country and take back power from the billionaire class. https://t.co/e0kuykdLXF

Seven years ago President Obama announced the DACA program. I am inspired by Dreamers and the movement they built for immigration justice. 

This is a promise: As president, I will provide immediate legal status for Dreamers.
On this 7th anniversary of #DACA, I‚Äôm reflecting on how the bravery of those undocumented youth that made it happen is what empowered me to be who I am today.

Republicans want to suppress votes and gerrymander districts because they can't win on their ideas. That is cowardice.

We have a better idea: make it easier for all people to vote, run for office and get involved in politics. That is democracy.

Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is lying again. No. He has not "called on Congress to bring down the cost of health care and prescription drugs." What he did do was ask Congress to throw 32 million Americans off the health care they have. https://t.co/LWLniIAEv9

At the end of the day, the 1 percent may have enormous wealth and power, but they are just the 1 percent. When the 99 percent stand together, we can transform society.
 
These are my values, and that is why I call myself a democratic socialist.  
#DemocraticSocialism
"When Trump screams socialism, all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the American people," @BernieSanders naming Trump a bunch in this speech.
 
"He believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful. I believe in democratic socialism that works for American families."
At GW, @BernieSanders: ‚ÄúDemocratic Socialism means to me requiring and achieving political and economic freedom in every community in this country.‚Äù
We need a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights:

- The right to health care
- The right to education
- The right to a good job
- The right to affordable housing
- The right to a secure retirement
- The right to a clean environment

#DemocraticSocialism
.@BernieSanders lays out his " 21st century economic Bill of Rights:"

- A decent job that pays a living wage
- Quality health care
- Complete education
- Affordable housing
- A clean environment
- A secure retirement.
In 1944, FDR proposed an economic bill of rights but died a year later and was never able to fulfill that vision. Our job, 75 years later, is to complete what Roosevelt started.

That is why today, I am proposing a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights. #DemocraticSocialism. https://t.co/VvEUjIyoNk
La diferencia entre Trump y @BernieSanders es que el Presidente cree en el Socialismo para las corporac√≠ones y el Senador sabe que nuestro gobierno tiene una obligac√≠on al pueblo. Cuidado medico, educac√≠on, protejer el medio ambiente.. todos podemos! #DemocraticSocialism
‚ÄúIf you are the Trump family, you got $885 million worth of tax breaks &amp; subsidies for your family‚Äôs housing empire that is built on racial discrimination. When Trump screams socialism, his hypocrisy will not be lost on the American people.‚Äù - @BernieSanders #DemocraticSocialism
Here is the difference between Donald Trump and me. 

He believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful. 
 
I believe in a #DemocraticSocialism that works for the working families of this country.
Economic rights are human rights. 

#DemocraticSocialism https://t.co/NSVPciFkks
Donald Trump hates #DemocraticSocialism because it benefits working people, but he loves corporate socialism that enriches billionaires.
‚ÄúSocialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years... Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people.‚Äù ‚ÄìHarry Truman #DemocraticSocialism
We must recognize that in the 21st century, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, economic rights are human rights.
 
That is what I mean by #DemocraticSocialism. https://t.co/8mKRGSbHo7
"This is a president who supports breaking up families, building a border wall. It is of my belief that the United States must reject this and choose a path of justice and love." - @BernieSanders #democraticsocialism https://t.co/ttmEbpejak

-Quality health care
-A good education
-A good job that pays a living wage

-A clean environment.

#DemocraticSocialism y el #SocialismoDemocratico es vilificado simplemente por su intenc√≠on de protejer el pobre y marginalisado. Justos ganamos contra injusticia! @BernieSanders
It is my very strong belief that the United States must reject the path of hatred and divisiveness‚Äîand instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path, a higher path. A path of compassion, justice and love.

.@BernieSanders receives an ovation from supporters in DC at a speech on Democratic Socialism as he quotes FDR:

"Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate... They are unanimous in their hate for me, and I welcome their hatred.
We can never forget that FDR, whose New Deal initiatives are considered pillars of American society today, was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as ‚Äúsocialism.‚Äù #DemocraticSocialism
‚ÄúCapitalism is not just an academic debate. The rich get richer and live longer. The poor and the working class have a declining life expectancy for the first time in a long time in modern American history.‚Äù ~Bernie Sanders #DemocraticSocialism
Here‚Äôs what #DemocraticSocialism looks like in action: 

- Medicare (&amp; Medicare for All)

- Free public college

- The US Postal Service

- Public libraries

- The VA

- The polio vaccine

- National parks

- Fire departments

 These are the basics of a decent society.
#DemocraticSocialism means people over corporations. It means the future of our planet over fossil fuel profits. It means peace, not endless war.

In 2017, four of the Waltons made $12.7 billion in one day.

To make as much as the Waltons did in that one day, it would take a @Walmart worker working ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù at $11 an hour more than 257,000 YEARS.

This is why we demand an end to their greed. #BernieAtWalmart
Fresh off his remarks at today's Walmart shareholders' meeting, @BernieSanders' campaign announces he'll march with McDonald's workers in Cedar Rapids Sunday ahead of the Iowa Dems Hall of Fame event.

@BernieSanders went into a stockholder meeting AT WALMART and told them that they are paying their workers ‚Äústarvation wages.‚Äù 

He openly confronted their greed. While they make billions in profit, their employees can hardly get by

 https://t.co/4ul4sQenzd
Walmart spent $8.3 billion on stock buybacks to enrich its shareholders in 2017.

That‚Äôs enough money to increase wages from $11 to $15 an hour for nearly 1 million workers.

Here‚Äôs how we end this greed: Give workers representation on Walmart‚Äôs corporate board. #BernieAtWalmart
We're demanding that the Waltons:

‚úÖ Respect workers' right to form a union
‚úÖ Pay a living wage of $15/hr
‚úÖ Guarantee 7 days paid sick leave
‚úÖ Give hourly workers a seat on the board

These are the bare minimum to ensure dignity for @Walmart workers. #BernieAtWalmart

And stop blocking them from joining a union.

‚ÄúAmerican families are sick &amp; tired of financing greed....‚Äù - @BernieSanders on behalf of @Walmart workers at the shareholder‚Äôs meeting. Bottom line: 
@Walmart made 10 billion in profits and pays its CEO 20 million. Certainly they can afford to pay their workers a living wage.
I just left the Walmart stockholders meeting where I demanded that @Walmart put hourly employees on their board of directors. We won't stop fighting until every worker makes at least $15 an hour. #BernieAtWalmart https://t.co/0iPN1efIZm

In my view, if McDonald‚Äôs has enough money to buy back $22 billion of its own stock, it damn well has enough money to pay all of its workers at least $15 an hour.
If Amazon can raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, there is no reason that McDonald‚Äôs‚Äîa company that took in $1.4 billion in profit and paid its CEO $22 million‚Äîcan‚Äôt also pay its workers a living wage.
A lot of 2020 candidates are throwing their support behind strikes. But @BernieSanders is taking it to a new level by using his email lists to directly rally support for picket lines, as he did today for striking McDonald's workers. My story: https://t.co/KFIAS6JKFN

Thurgood Marshall said that all children have a right ‚Äúto an equal opportunity to reach their full potential as citizens."

In my view, the only way to accomplish that goal is to guarantee every person in our country a quality education as a fundamental human right.
All over America teachers are telling us that they should not have to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet.

When we defeat Trump, we are going require states to pay teachers a solid starting salary, and that includes cost-of-living increases.
The @NAACP has been demanding a ban on for-profit charter schools and a moratorium on federal funding of new charter schools until we can ensure they‚Äôre operating with transparency and accountability.

I agree. As president I will institute that ban and implement that moratorium.
Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in the modern history of our country. We need an Education Secretary who is a fierce advocate for public education and working class children and works to integrate our schools‚Äînot who is doing everything she can to undermine them.
Out of 35 major countries the U.S. ranks 30th in math, 24th in reading, and 19th in science.

Let me be as clear as I can: as the wealthiest country in the history of the world there is no reason we shouldn't have the best education system in the world.
I'm the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket.

When people see the justice of an idea, it spreads like fire. #FightFor15 https://t.co/nb44Kb5RKP
On this 65th anniversary of the Brown v Board of Education decision, we are going to tear down barriers for black and brown children and create an education system that works for all people, not just the wealthy and powerful.

Donald Trump thinks he can win reelection by dividing us up. I've got news for him. That's not a path toward victory. We will defeat him by doing the opposite ‚Äì bringing our people together.  Join us as we continue to fight for justice in Charlotte, NC: https://t.co/HXFvbjWMFn
Abortion bans in Georgia, Alabama, Ohio and elsewhere are dangerous, regressive, and blatantly unconstitutional. We will fight them in every way possible. https://t.co/l6K8SdHKNC
Donald Trump betrayed working people in Wisconsin and across America. He is a liar and we will defeat him and put working people first. https://t.co/bE7KaFmBo8
When we talk about fighting for justice, we mean ending institutional racism in all its ugly forms.
LGBTQ Americans are still at risk of being fired, evicted and denied services. In the year 2019, that is totally unacceptable.

I am proud to see the House pass the #EqualityAct so that every LGBTQ person in America is protected from discrimination. This is an historic day. https://t.co/XCLKA60OxF
As president I will stand with groups like the @NAACP and put a moratorium on federal funding of new charter schools until rules are in place to make sure they are operating with transparency and accountability.
Charter schools are led by unaccountable, private bodies, and their growth has drained funding from the public school system. When we are in the White House we will ban for-profit charter schools. https://t.co/LGY3ZaWiVm
Bernie Sanders takes the stage at his Asheville, NC rally. Local police said they capped enclosed area at 2,000 people, with an overflow of several hundred outside. ‚ÄúThe underlying principles of our government will not be greed, will not be hatred, will not be lies,‚Äù Sanders says https://t.co/ELTuSc8zlI
I want to welcome you to a campaign which says that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred and lies. Those ugly anti-American sentiments of the Trump administration are going to end and end soon. Join us live in Asheville: https://t.co/Ws7BBcmn6j
I stand with workers from @UPTECWA, @CWAUnion and @AFSCME who are striking to stop outsourcing at @UofCalifornia. Thank you for speaking up to protect health care, research and education at these great public universities. https://t.co/Aj0X8NgB2u
Trump is proposing to send our nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. That would be a disaster. We must stop building new nuclear power plants, and find a real solution to our existing nuclear waste problem. https://t.co/O6iO0q1Z2B
A war in Iran would make the Iraq war look like a walk in the park. It will be an unmitigated disaster.

Tell Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit Trump from taking military action against Iran without Congressional approval: https://t.co/zzwVU8sech
Thank you @JoshShapiroPA for standing up to stop predatory companies from profiting off the student debt crisis. When we are in the White House, we are going to end this kind of greed. https://t.co/VRuJWO9iyV
The abortion ban in Alabama is not about protecting life. It is about controlling women's bodies. https://t.co/oWTWDrDzVf
3,800%.

That's how much the cost of four-year public college has increased since 1964.

In that time, how many bright young people gave up the chance at a college education because they couldn't afford it?

We will make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
Republican legislators are trying to strip away women's rights state by state. This is a frightening time, but we will not let them win. We will fight back and not only defend women's rights, but expand them. https://t.co/yCy1QIQK9k
Congratulations to activists in New York for stopping the Williams Pipeline! If we are going to confront the crisis of climate change, we must stop new pipelines and rapidly transition to 100% renewable energy. https://t.co/zC6kZEQkr9
We're live with @BernieSanders. What questions do you have for him?

This is shameful. A fourth child has died after being detained by Border Patrol since December. Our job is to provide protection and due process to those fleeing violence and persecution‚Äînot to threaten the safety of families and children at the border and tear families apart. https://t.co/TyeZQeR3Vc
In the last 10 years the oil and gas industry spent $700+ million on campaign contributions and $1.5 billion on lobbying.

In return they get hundreds of billions in subsidies every year while destroying the planet.

We must end subsidies and tax breaks for oil and gas companies. https://t.co/K17EAqb26x
In no state in America does support for a total ban on abortion‚Äîlike Alabama just passed‚Äîreach even 25%. The extremist attacks on abortion rights must end. #AlabamaAbortionBan https://t.co/8X9fId1VPR
Extremist politicians in every state have worked for decades to ban abortion. We will not let them win. #AlabamaAbortionBan https://t.co/d5DzxVadvg
The governor of Alabama just signed a near-total ban on abortion. What an utter disgrace.

But we will not give up. Donate now to @ARC_Southeast, @AbortionFunds and @YellowFund to help low-income women get support for the abortions they need: https://t.co/483kQ4zDXJ
Millennials aren't struggling because they're lazy or wasting their money on avocados. They face unprecedented economic challenges due to decades of policies to help corporations and the top 1% while leaving working people behind.
When fundamental rights are under attack, we must respond and do the most good that we can. In the wake of the abortion ban passed in Alabama, donate here to three abortion support networks so that low-income women can get abortions and reproductive care: https://t.co/gvKBOPHtRQ
It's simply not acceptable that a wealthy corporation like Southwest Airlines is switching passenger service work at LAX away from union contractors.

We must support the trade union movement. When unions are strong, the middle class is strong. #PovertyDoesntFly https://t.co/z2dv2Fe4bB
Thank you @BernieSanders for supporting our fight for LGBTQ families! https://t.co/E1L3xmN89s
